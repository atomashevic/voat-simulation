  - Core Percentage: 0.462 ± 0.263
  - Density: 0.000 ± 0.000

KEY FINDINGS
------------
DIFFERENCES:
  - Simulation1 has 24.4% core nodes vs Reddit's ~0.7% average
  - Simulation1 density is ~7.8x higher than Reddit samples
  - Simulation1 average degree is ~3.7x higher

SIMILARITIES:
  - Core-periphery structure is present in both networks
  - Similar degree distribution patterns (power law characteristics)
  - Comparable clustering patterns (relative to network density)
  - Similar network fragmentation patterns

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Simulation1 successfully replicates core-periphery structure of Reddit
2. Consider adjusting simulation parameters to reduce network density
3. Core formation mechanisms appear realistic despite size differences
4. User behavior patterns show structural similarities to real data
