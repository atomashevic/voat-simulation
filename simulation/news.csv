56,Hacklabs and hackerspaces â tracing two genealogies »  The Journal of Peer Production,"Hackerspaces are workshops organised with an open community model where people with technological interests can come together to socialise, collaborate, share and expand their knowledge. The last few years have seen an increased activity in this area including the founding of many new locations, increasing cooperation and discussions about the potentialities and the directions of hackerspaces. Similar spaces, however, called hacklabs, have existed ever since personal computers became widespread. Hacklabs are typically based on a political agenda. These new and old places are often seen retrospectively as part of a single trajectory and most of the discourse treats hacklabs and hackespaces as equivalent. Outlining the overlapping but still distinguishable genealogies of both hackerspaces and hacklabs will prove helpful in questioning the tendency to confound the two and can further contribute to the contemporary debates over this vibrant culture and movement. The article ends with a reflection from a strategic point of view how hackerspaces and hacklabs contribute to the production of postcapitalist subjectivities through their organisational dynamics. The findings are based on personal experiences and field work, mainly at a now-defunct hacklab in London (the Hackney Crack House) and a hackerspace in Budapest (the Hungarian Autonomous Center for Knowledge).",2,20250826,http://peerproduction.net/issues/issue-2/peer-reviewed-papers/hacklabs-and-hackerspaces/

232,Michael Robertson: Use Skype - Go Directly To A Chinese Prison,"A research firm recently revealed that eBay and TOM are colluding with
                  the Chinese government to spy on users of Skype. Together they monitored
                  user's text chats and stored those containing politically sensitive
                  topics like freedom, democracy, Tibet, opposition to the communist
                  party and Falun Gong. They also track voice call participants.
                  Presumably they turned this data over to the government and it's
                  impossible to track how that data has been used.
“What people have been implicated by their Skype usage and
subsequently interrogated, imprisoned or executed?”
If history can be a guide it's logical to assume that the data
                  resulted in prison terms or worse. In 2005, Yahoo was involved in a
                  similar disclosed incident in which it turned over emails to
                  authorities which netted a 10 year prison sentence for a reporter who
                  dared to talk about democracy. I wrote about it when it happened and
                  questioned where one draws the line chasing the almight dollar (or
                  Yuan). Two years later Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang was in front of Congress
                  explaining the situation and apologizing to the mother of the
                  imprisoned.
In response to the revelation of spying on calls and instant messages
                  a spokesman for Skype incredibly stated that Skype is ""the most secure
                  forum of publicly available communication."" eBay points the finger at
                  their Chinese partner TOM claiming they had ""no knowledge or consent""
                  of this privacy breach. This level of compromise requires access to
                  source code which eBay would have had to provide them. Maybe eBay
                  didn't have direct knowledge of these alterations. However no one can
                  deny China's well known efforts to police and censor their citizens
                  net activities which surely eBay executives know about. To provide the
                  source code with no auditing or oversight shows at best a convenient
                  excuse. One wonders how long this would have continued without the whistleblower
                  and how many other countries Skype cooperates with to allow the same spying.
More likely at least some within eBay/Skype knew exactly what TOM was
                  doing and consented because it gave them access to the enormous
                  Chinese market. Its estimated that nearly half of Skype users are from
                  China. This is why Cisco and others design special networking
                  equipment enabling the Chinese government to snoop and lock down their
                  country's net activities. Similar to Skype they are lured by the
                  dollars awaiting any country that cracks the Chinese market.
I would call on eBay to be forthcoming with information on this
                  situation by publicly disclosing details of this situation which will
                  require tough questions of their partner and Chinese government. This
                  would demonstrate that eBay's publicly stated ""concern"" is more than a press
                  tactic. Specific questions eBay should answer include:

When did this spying start?
What users did it affect?
When specifically did it stop? Has it stopped?
What specific terms were monitored? (Users have a right to know if their messages have been implicated.)
What people have been implicated by their Skype usage and subsequently interrogated, imprisoned or executed?
What steps will be taken to defend these people or get their convictions overturned?
Has previously stored data been deleted? How can users be sure?
What will eBay do to insure that this spying isn't reactivated as soon as the press attention subsides?
What other companies and countries are monitoring Skype communications?
What auditing steps is eBay implementing to make sure this does not happen again?

Let me be clear about Gizmo5's policy and refute Skype's spokeman's claim that Skype is the ""most secure"".
                  Gizmo5 doesn't spy on calls and messages and we wouldn't give that info to any government. We encrypt calls between
                  Gizmo5 users and have given no one the decrypt key. We would not allow a partner or government to do wholesale monitoring
                  of communications - no matter how many billions of prospective customers they have. If ordered to take action by a
                  government that defies basic Western freedoms we would do it only under threat of imprisonment and the information
                  would then be disclosed in this blog condemning the action and striving to defend any of those adversely impacted.
                  I challenge eBay/Skype to do the same. Defend their users. Defend their brand. Defend freedom.

This number varies between about 32 and 37 ppt. Rainfall, evaporation, river runoff, and ice formation cause the variations. For example, the Black Sea is so diluted by river runoff, its average salinity is only 16 ppt. Freshwater salinity is usually less than 0.5 ppt. Water between 0.5 ppt and 17 ppt is called brackish. Estuaries, where fresh river water meets salty ocean water, are examples of brackish waters.

337,List SPNs in Active Directory using PowerShell ~ ITAdminTools.com,"How to list SPNs in Active Directory using PowerShell. A Service Principal Name (SPN) is a service name that is registered in Active Directory, and is associated with a computer or user account (the security context in which the service runs).  The standard AD tools don't give you a good way to figure out where an SPN is registered, or list what SPNs are registered in your AD.


-->


To locate a specific SPN, check out our posts Finding an SPN in Active Directory using Perl and Finding an SPN in Active Directory using VBScript.

The PowerShell script below finds all SPNs in your domain of the service type that you specify.  In the example below, I have the service type set to ""HTTP"", so the script returns all of the HTTP/ SPNs.  The script uses the directorySearcher .Net class to find the accounts with HTTP/ SPNs.


$serviceType=""HTTP""

$spns = @{}

$filter = ""(servicePrincipalName=$serviceType/*)""
$domain = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry
$searcher = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher
$searcher.SearchRoot = $domain
$searcher.PageSize = 1000
$searcher.Filter = $filter
$results = $searcher.FindAll()

foreach ($result in $results){
 $account = $result.GetDirectoryEntry()
 foreach ($spn in $account.servicePrincipalName.Value){
  if($spn.contains(""$serviceType/"")){
   $spns[$(""$spn`t$($account.samAccountName)"")]=1;
  }
 }
}

$spns.keys | sort-object
