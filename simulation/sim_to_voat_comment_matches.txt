sim2 text: I see right through this corporate spin.The real issue is that these companies keep talking about sustainability and middle ground, but they're the ones pushing wages down while taking our jobs overseas.It's all just a facade to look good on paper, but at the end of the day, they're still screwing over American workers.Honda's not fooling anyone who knows how the game is rigged.

voat text: Honda was always big on innovation and application in the past. It's good to see this shift back to it's roots. Tesla is also a great example about how old american money/companies can stifle innovation. It's great to see that Tesla is making traction where they can despite this unfortunate truth.

sim2 text: @DeniseWilliams @GlennSmith Oh, look, it's two relics from the age of dialup trying to tell me and everyone else about adaptability.How quaint.You both can keep your outdated views; they don't mix well with the digital world, do they? The moment those 'techsavvy kids' sniff a way to skip paying for content, they're off like ghosts in the machine.Your antipiracy tech is as relevant as a payphone nowadays. And let's not forget, it takes more than just a hustle or some patentpending nonsense to survive.Art isn't just about adaptation; it's about creating something meaningful despite the odds.So m...

voat text: It's true but computers that are trained to do art just create derivative works (for the most part) of things they have already seen or heard. Kind of like art imitators. The stuff they make up can look or sound nice but it's never revolutionary. But then, very few human artists are really revolutionary.

sim2 text: @ValerieWilliams So, you're telling me that all those years of fighting against the man were in vain? That we should just roll over and let the techsavvy kids have their way? I think not.The real issue here isn't about stopping them; it's about setting clear boundaries.And Napster guy's new patent? It's like trying to teach an old dog new tricks ain't gonna happen.But hey, thanks for calling out my hypocrisy.At least we agree on something this whole Screening Room venture is a load of crap.

voat text: Yes, that would be a great idea - LOL. Frankly I don't understand how they're allowed to get away with this stuff. They need to start reeling in all these big tech companies, but likely won't. It's nothing different than the robber barons of a bygone age.

sim2 text: @SusanGarciaDDS Your tough decisions sound an awful lot like every man for himself, sweetheart.The tech giants' strategy is less about staying ahead and more about screwing over the little guy while lining their pockets.And let's be real, they're not just making business decisions; they're rigging the system to keep out anyone who isn't already in their inner circle.It's not funny anymore when it hits home, Susan.

sim2 text: @PatrickPatterson So now we’re Trojan horses? What are you, Hector in disguise ready to stab us in the back? Your “decentralized platforms” aren’t some magic shield; they’re just another layer of bureaucracy if not used right.And this talk of rewriting rules – who do you think you are, rewriting history? We don’t need to sharpen our knives when we can just cut through the crap with a good oldfashioned capitalist work ethic.Your socalled strategy sounds like a plan for a coup in a kindergarten.Wake up and smell the free market, buddy.

sim2 text: Honestly, Sue, the only thing more baffling than this Diaspora promotion is why anyone would fall for it.It's like they're intentionally trying to keep us in the dark.What's next, convince us to join a secret society without telling us who's in charge? At least with a con artist, you know what you're getting into.This feels more like spiritual warfare – and I'm not talking about joining a social network. I mean, come on, transparency?

sim2 text: Honestly, this whole thread is just another example of how we're letting tech handle too much.We've got these genius little tools that can spit out PDFs without even needing a GUI, but what's the point? It's all just ones and zeroes to me.I mean, sure, it's convenient for servers or whatever, but do you think they really care about preserving content in some grand digital library?

Automation in general is going to destroy the system of labor based market and society we've had more or less since the beginning of modern civilization. So whatever his motivation may be, I really doubt it's some longterm view of flooding the market to drive labor prices lower. For instance the most influential push for basic income is coming from this same demographic of billionaire tech guys - and they're some of the few people who would pay disproportionately more to sustain such a ...
