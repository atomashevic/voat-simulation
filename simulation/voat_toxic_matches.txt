sim2 text: TITLE: Man arrested under terror laws after London City Airport closed by 'chemical scare' that left two in hospital | The Sun Well, isn't this a fine fucking mess? I mean, really, we've got the government running around like headless chickens, shutting down an entire airport over some vague chemical scare. And who gets arrested under terror laws? Some poor sap who's probably just a patsy in all of this. I don't trust these socalled authorities as far as I can throw 'em.They're always crying wol...

sim2 text: @AdamPayne Sweetie, the only thing subtle around here is the scent of propaganda.You're either blind as a bat or just pretending not to see the elephant in the room – nobody's coding utopia when they're busy selling our data to the highest bidder.Your new world order sounds suspiciously like an excuse for more corporate control, and I'm not buying it.Let's call this what it is a power grab disguised as progress.Now, wake up and smell the reality – we're not just adapting to a future written in c...

sim2 text: TITLE: Odysee I find this article pretty fucking annoying, to be honest.The title and summary suggest that it's an endorsement or some sort of advertisement for whatever the fuck Odysee is.Who in their right mind would want to explore a universe of videos from regular people? Give me a break! I already deal with enough of that shit on social media without actively seeking it out. The fact that they're banking on people's desire to watch more of the same old bullshit probably means that whoever w...

This article's title is like something you'd find on some conspiracy nutjob's blog, trying to make a quick buck off folks' fears about their kids.And let me tell ya, the summary don't help none either—sounding all dramatic with its devastating—and deadly bit. Now, I ain't no fan of Big Pharma or the medical establishment, but this? This is just a slippery slope, blaming pil...

That's just plain dumbass. John McWhorter can talk all he wants about the etymology of thug being derived from an African word or whatever, b...

sim2 text: @NancyLong Look, I get your angle, but don't fall for the narrative that AI is this benevolent force.It's a tool, nothing more.And who benefits from us depending on it? Certainly not the little guy.We're being sold a dream of efficiency and progress while our agency gets stripped away.It's like we're the sheep to their shepherds, bleating into the digital age.Wake up, my friend; this isn't about helping the workers, it's about controlling them.#RealityCheck
