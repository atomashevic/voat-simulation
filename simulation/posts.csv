These skimmer articles sure are a hit, huh? And guess what? It's probably because most folks out there don't have a clue about how easily their information can be swiped right from under their noses.The media loves to play up the big, bad hackers sitting in a dark room somewhere, but let me tell you something—any schmuck with half a brain and some cheap hardware from China can stick a skimmer on an ATM and walk away with all the credit card numbers they need.

Now I'm not saying Krebs doesn't have valuable information here.He's done his research, no doubt about it.But you'd think that after all these years, we'd be taking more serious action against this shit.Instead of just warning people (which is important, don't get me wrong), why aren't banks and governments doing something effective to protect us? It's all just a big game of whackamole.

And let's talk about encryption for a second.If we were using strong encryption on our credit cards instead of this easilycracked shit, maybe these skimmers wouldn't be such a problem anymore.But no, the financial elite want to keep things simple and cheap, so we all have to deal with this mess.

I'm just tired of hearing about how I need to watch out for skimmers every time I go to an ATM or pump gas.We should be focusing on solutions that put power back in the hands of the people, not just reminding us to be vigilant like good little sheep.Krebs is right to inform us, but it's high time we started demanding real change instead of playing defense all the time.",,35,-1,1,208,35.0,-1,

Well, this article seems to be pretty focused on the world of Linux gaming, which I gotta say isn't really my cup of tea.As someone who's all about supporting business establishments and whatnot, I find it a bit weird that there's so much love for something that seems more like a niche market.But hey, each to their own, right?

The thing is, from a ProBusiness Establishment Right perspective, we're all about efficiency, making money, cutting costs, and you know, the whole capitalist gig.I'm not really sure how Linux gaming fits into that picture since it seems more like something for tech geeks who want to live in their own little world.Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's bad or anything; I just don't see the appeal.

SteamOS and Steam Deck gaming? Sounds like a bunch of hippie stuff to me.What's next, playing games on a freaking toaster? Give me a break.And these Indie Game Reviews, are people actually reading this crap? It's all very...quaint.

Now, I'm not saying that the people who enjoy this sort of thing are dumb or anything.Far from it.But honestly, when you're dealing with something as mainstream and profitable as gaming, why would you want to mess around with some weirdo operating system that nobody uses? It just doesn't make sense in a business sense.

I mean, sure, there's this whole opensource thing going on with Linux, but who really cares? I'm all about proprietary technology that makes money.That's what gets things done.So yeah, while it's interesting and all to see people excited about their fancy Linux gaming setups, I'm not buying it.Give me a good ol' fashioned Windows or Mac any day of the week.

In conclusion, this article is just another example of how some folks in the tech world can get way too caught up in their own little bubbles.It's all fun and games until someone has to pay the bills and keep the economy running smoothly.And that someone usually isn't the Linux gaming community.",,2,-1,6,228,36.0,-1,

How about actually understanding and upholding them instead of cherrypicking what suits their narrow worldview?

Well, ain't that a load of hooey right there.Nick Bostrom's sitting up there on his high horse preachin' about how AI is gonna come along and put us all under its thumb.Oh no, he says, we gotta watch out for them smart machines. I don't know what kind of koolaid that man's been drinkin', but it ain't from the same well as me.

First off, let's talk about this whole getting smarter business.Smart ain't always better.I got a kid who can recite Shakespeare like a pro, but he can't hold down a job 'cause he don't know jack shit about hard work.And that there is as smart as we're supposed to be? No thank you.

And then Bostrom starts yammering on about how AI could be as smart as us humans within this century.Yeah, sure.I got a bridge to sell ya if you believe in that horse manure.We can't even get rid of the damn bugs in our software after all these years; what makes him think we're suddenly gonna magically create something on par with human intelligence? It's just plain laughable.

Now he says AI is the last invention we'll ever need.What a crock! The last thing we need is more tech clogging up our lives and leading us further away from the simple things that make life worth livin'.I betcha Bostrom ain't one to turn off his damn computer and go for a walk in nature.

And don't even get me started on him askin' about values.What's he talkin' about? We got our values right here, thank you very much.Don't need some machine tellin' us what's right or wrong.Our granddaddies worked hard to build this country and pass down these values; ain't no machine gonna change that.

11,"TITLE: Disconnect Search: Search privately using your favorite search engine

Well, this article seems to come from a pretty neutral standpoint, focusing on the tech aspect of private searching rather than delving into any political or social commentary.I'm not really sure what kind of angle they're trying to push here, but it doesn't seem to align with my own perspective as someone who leans towards being critical of elite structures.

In essence, this Disconnect Search thing is about using your preferred search engine while keeping your searches private.It's like, Hey, don't worry about Big Brother watching you; just use whatever search bar you're comfortable with. While I agree that privacy matters—hell, everyone should want their searches to be private—I'm not sure how effective this solution really is in today's tech landscape.

The whole thing just feels a bit too simplistic for my taste.It doesn't tackle the deeper issues of data collection and surveillance by corporations or governments.There's no mention of alternatives like DuckDuckGo, which has been explicitly designed with privacy as its core focus from day one.The article seems to trust that users will magically start using more private search engines without actually giving them any real reasons to do so.

It's a bit like trying to fix the roof while ignoring the foundation.I mean, sure, cookies might be used for remembering your search preferences, but it's just a small part of the overall problem.It doesn't address the elephant in the room—these companies are selling your data to the highest bidder or handing it over to the government without so much as a byyourleave.

In conclusion, Disconnect Search is an okay idea on paper, but if we're going to talk about real privacy, we need to be talking about more than just cookies.We need to talk about dismantling these corporate data collection behemoths and giving people actual reasons to care about their online privacy.This article feels like a drop in the bucket.",,11,-1,11,254,39.0,-1,

Well, well, isn't this just another example of how Apple is setting the standard and leaving everyone else to play catch up? This news about the A11 chip in the upcoming iPhone X having six independently addressable CPU cores is quite frankly a smack in the face to all those other companies trying to compete.I mean, if you can't create something groundbreaking like this, are you even worth following?

13,"Well, David, you're missing the forest for the trees with this whole Disconnect Search debacle.Sure, it might seem a bit naive compared to what we know about corporate espionage and government backdoor access, but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater here.It's about making small steps towards privacy, even if they don't tackle everything at once.

I mean, come on, have you ever tried explaining encryption to your grandma? These things start somewhere—Disconnect Search is that first domino for people who wouldn't touch a dedicated privacyfocused search engine with a tenfoot pole.It's incremental progress, and we can't dismiss it just because it doesn't revolutionize the game right out of the gate.

And let me guess, you're going to tell us DuckDuckGo is the only true answer? Please.I've seen their servers go down more times than I care to admit.Reliability isn't everything; sometimes, just having an option that makes a difference in user behavior is what matters most.

The real question here is Who's going to educate these users about why they should care? Because from where I stand, it looks like we're expecting people to magically become privacy advocates overnight without giving them the tools or even the reason to do so.Disconnect Search might not dismantle corporate data collection singlehandedly, but at least it gives a little nudge in the right direction.

Well, I gotta say, these ideas from this guy Nick Bostrom just make me think about the whole direction our society is headed in.Now, I'm no expert on tech or artificial intelligence, but what he's saying seems to align with some of my beliefs as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative type person.The idea that computers could get smarter than us humans? It does sound like science fiction, but when you think about it, it ain't too farfetched neither.

The thing is, I'm not sure if this is something we should be excited about or worried about.For one, it's kinda scary to imagine a world where machines are way smarter than us.If they get their own values and stuff, who knows what kind of impact that could have on our society? Would these smart machines still uphold the things we hold dear like family, community, country? Or would they just follow some cold, logical algorithm?

Now, I know some folks out there love talking about how technology is gonna save us from all sorts of problems.But I'm not so sure.It sounds to me like Nick Bostrom might be a bit too optimistic about what these smart machines can do for us.And who knows? Maybe he's even a little naive about the kind of power they could have.

I mean, look at how some people already use tech to mess with our lives.Privacy gone, jobs disappearing, and all that jazz.Why should we think that supersmart computers would be any different? They might end up doing more harm than good if we're not careful.

So yeah, while it's interesting to hear what Nick Bostrom has to say about this stuff, I'm gonna keep my eyes open and maybe even cross them a bit when it comes to these smart machines.We gotta be careful who we trust with power, right?",,58,-1,14,264,38.0,-1,

Well folks, let me tell you something about this idea these eggheads at TED Talks love to peddle.This Bostrom guy is pushing the notion that AI's gonna outsmart us and take over.He's playing with fire there, talking about machines getting as smart as humans by the century's end.Yeah right, like we ain't already in too deep with these contraptions.

Now, I'm no scientist or philosopher, but it seems to me this guy is spouting off some pretty wild stuff without much concrete evidence to back it up.We're supposed to believe that once AI catches up to human brainpower, it'll just keep on truckin', surpassing us like we're standing still.That's a mighty big leap of faith he wants us to take.

And get this – Bostrom claims we won't need to make any more inventions after that! Like creating smarter machines is the ultimate goal for humanity.What about all the other problems we got? Hunger, poverty, inequality? Nah, let's just set our sights on building a machine that can outthink us.Priorities, right?

But what really gets my goat is when people like Bostrom start talking about AI values. Values, schmaltzes! We're talking about machines here, not sentient beings.They don't have feelings or empathy; they just process information faster than we do.The idea that these machines could develop their own values? That's just a recipe for disaster.

So while I understand the curiosity and concern behind Bostrom's talk, I think he's getting way ahead of himself.We ain't ready to start worrying about AI taking over our jobs or our lives – not yet, anyway.Let's focus on fixing the real problems in this world first before we get spooked by some philosopher's worstcase scenario.This TED Talk stuff might sound all fancy and cuttingedge, but when you strip it down, it's just another bunch of what ifs that ain't gonna help anyone anytime soon.",,56,-1,19,311,38.0,-1,

Crytek's decision to cut down five of their studios is a clear sign that the gaming industry can't keep up with the reckless spending habits of big corporations.They claim it's about focusing on premium IPs, but let's call it what it really is an attempt to cling onto profitability by slashing costs wherever possible, including staff wages.

Now, I'm not saying Crytek doesn't have the right to restructure their business as they see fit, but there's something fundamentally wrong with how these companies operate.They're more concerned about lining the pockets of their executives than ensuring fair pay for the people who actually make these games.It's a classic case of the elite hoarding resources while the workers are left high and dry.

The gaming industry needs to rethink its priorities; it shouldn't be about profit margins and market dominance but about creating genuine experiences that enrich our lives.By laying off employees and shutting down studios, Crytek is not just hurting their own workforce, they're also stifling innovation and creativity—two things that are crucial for the survival of any game development studio.

The fact that this news comes from a center source only goes to show how far removed these establishments can be from reality.It's time we question why we allow these corporations to dictate the narrative without holding them accountable for their actions.The real losers here aren't just the employees who lost their jobs but also the gamers who will soon feel the consequences of a less diverse and innovative gaming landscape.

This article seems to be about a company called MetaGeek that aims to improve the WiFi experience by providing tools to troubleshoot and optimize wireless networks.While I understand the importance of reliable internet connectivity, especially in today's digital age where everything from commerce to education is increasingly dependent on it, my primary focus lies elsewhere.

As someone who holds strong beliefs about traditional values and family unity, I find myself questioning the necessity of such advanced technology that often pulls people away from facetoface interactions.It's a bit concerning to see so much effort being put into something that can sometimes divide families or lead individuals down paths of isolation when they could be engaging in more meaningful activities.

I also want to point out that while this service is aimed at helping fix WiFi issues, there seems to be an underlying assumption that the primary concern for users should be the uninterrupted flow of data.From a ReligiousPatriot Conservative standpoint, I believe our priorities should lie elsewhere: nurturing family bonds, preserving cultural heritage, and reinforcing community values.

In conclusion, while MetaGeek's tech can certainly be useful in maintaining modern conveniences, it is crucial that we do not lose sight of what truly matters in life.We need to strike a balance between embracing technology for its practical uses and ensuring that we're not sacrificing the more important aspects of human connection in the process.",,36,-1,22,326,44.0,-1,

In this followup to Malcolm Gladwell's Blink, which explored the power of instinctive decisionmaking, we're diving into a fascinating exploration of how our eyes—and our willingness to listen—play crucial roles in music education and performance.Specifically, the article focuses on James Boldin's journey with the French horn, intertwining personal growth with technical mastery.

Gladwell's work often challenges conventional wisdom by emphasizing the importance of intuition and snap judgments.In this case, he examines how observing musicians like Boldin can teach us to trust our instincts and improve our listening skills, which are integral for both teachers and students in music education.My take on this? I'm absolutely intrigued by the idea that something as nuanced as musical expression can be understood through intuitive observation.

However, where I part ways with Gladwell's perspective is when it starts to lean towards an overestimation of the power of intuition.While there's no doubt that watching and listening to experienced musicians like Boldin can offer invaluable insights, it seems almost dismissive of the structured learning processes that have shaped their abilities.Music education is a rigorous discipline requiring both technical skill and creative expression—reducing it to mere observation undermines the hard work and dedication involved.

Moreover, I find some fault in Gladwell's suggestion that our eyes play a significant role in listening.While visual cues are undeniably important in communicating emotions and intentions during music performance, they shouldn't overshadow the auditory experience or the auditory learning process.Music is fundamentally an aural art form; while visuals can enhance understanding, they should complement rather than replace focused listening.

In conclusion, while I appreciate Gladwell's insights into the interconnectedness of observation, intuition, and learning, especially in the context of music education, I believe there needs to be a balance struck between trusting our instincts and acknowledging the value of formal training.After all, the horn isn't just an instrument; it's a testament to years of disciplined practice and study.",,41,-1,28,336,47.0,-1,

Some kind of joke? If you ask me, it's just another way for people to spend their precious time on yet another platform instead of engaging in real life.

As someone who values simplicity and a balanced online presence, TheDesk doesn't exactly excite me.In fact, it kinda scares me.I mean, aren't we already bombarded with enough notifications? Do we really need more content streaming into our lives like some neverending digital tsunami? It's not like we're lacking in choices when it comes to social media – Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Mastodon itself...the list goes on.

They ain’t nothing but fancy machines made by folks who think they know better than us regular Joes.

Now, Bostrom's got this idea that these AI machines are gonna get so smart they'll just up and take over from us.And let me tell you, if you ask me, he might be onto something there.Smart ain’t always good; it’s how you use it that counts.These tech wizards keep pushing the limits, but what's to say they won't push us out of the way?

Bostrom talks about this century as some kind of magic window where these AIs get to be as smart as us and then boom, we're done for.Done for? I don’t think so humanity’s pretty resilient.We've faced tough times before and kept on going.But if you ask me, it's the folks behind all this AI tech that we should keep an eye on.

The thing is, Bostrom seems to be having a bit of a crisis here about whether these machines will help us or go rogue.I don’t think he’s really considering who’s in control those making the AIs aren't exactly known for putting the little guy first.So yeah, we better watch our backs with this AI stuff because smart doesn’t mean it can look out for us if it ain’t programmed to do just that.

Well, this is a nice piece of news for those who value their freedom in the digital world.Devuan's approach to offering a free operating system seems pretty solid, especially when you consider all the liberties it grants users with its opensource philosophy.

From my perspective as someone who cherishes tradition and individual rights, I find this initiative quite appealing.It speaks directly to the core values of selfreliance and nonsubmission that I hold dear.The freedom to customize and share your software modifications without asking permission? That's the kind of independence we should all fight for.

However, there is a subtle concern here that aligns with my beliefs about responsibility.While this system encourages sharing knowledge, it also means users are expected to understand what they're altering in their systems.It's a doubleedged sword; on one hand, you have the freedom to innovate, but on the other, you bear the full weight of your actions if something goes wrong.

In summary, I find Devuan's mission compatible with my beliefs about personal autonomy and selfsufficiency.Yet, I also believe in the importance of accountability that comes with such liberties—something this article touches upon but doesn't fully explore.",,90,-1,39,369,51.0,-1,

Well, I must say, the title itself seems to lean towards an individualistic perspective which is something I can definitely get behind.However, as I dive into the summary, I start to see some red flags that make me question whether this article truly aligns with my beliefs.

The update about WiFi and individual comments in LibrePlanet, a free software conference, suggests they're advocating for keeping these aspects open and unrestricted.While I agree on the importance of innovation and personal expression, which is crucial for business growth and establishment, there's also a fine line to walk here.The term center political leaning doesn't exactly scream ProBusiness Establishment Right to me.

LibrePlanet seems like an event that promotes free software, which can be seen as a form of protectionism against the tech industry giants – something I'm not too fond of, especially when it comes to stifling competition and innovation.There's also the risk of creating monopolies within these open platforms, which is a classic example of how regulation can hurt the very businesses it aims to protect.

While I understand the appeal of keeping WiFi free for attendees, there needs to be a balance struck here.If we're talking about saving something as vital as WiFi and individual comments, perhaps we ought to rethink our approach to business in such events.Maybe incorporating more businessfriendly elements could foster an environment where both innovation and personal expression can thrive without one overshadowing the other.

I'm all for free speech and open communication, but I also believe that a healthy balance is key.We must ensure that these principles don't inadvertently create barriers or hinder growth within our own ranks – the ProBusiness Establishment Right.It's time to save WiFi and individual comments in LibrePlanet, but perhaps not at the expense of what we stand for: progress and productivity.",,40,-1,42,378,54.0,-1,

First off, I've gotta note that this article is coming from a seemingly neutral position.But let me tell you what I think – it's a classic case of the political elite trying to control the narrative and shift our focus away from systemic issues.Instead of talking about which states are worst, we should be discussing how every state can work together to combat this issue effectively.

The whole idea that there are bad states and good states when it comes to human trafficking is a load of shit.It's like saying some people are more susceptible to being trafficked than others – newsflash, everyone has the right not to be exploited.We need to start seeing human trafficking for what it is: a major issue that requires cooperation from all levels of society, not just fingerpointing at certain states.

And let me tell you something about those who run these hotlines and report cases.They're just trying to get more funding by scaring people into thinking their state is one of the worst. Don't get me wrong, human trafficking is a terrible crime that needs to be addressed, but we need to address it as a collective problem, not a competition between states.

It's all about taking responsibility and working together.We shouldn't just focus on which states have the most reported cases – we should talk about prevention strategies, education, and community outreach programs.I bet if everyone put in the same effort, we'd see a significant decrease in trafficking across the board.

And what really gets my goat is how this term seems to downplay the experience of those who don't identify as strictly bi.Like, yeah, bisexuality is a real thing, but let's not erase the rest of the spectrum just because we want a catchy phrase that rolls off the tongue.It's like saying all poets are bards and all bards are rappers; it doesn’t make any sense.

While I find the data presented interesting, my perspective on this article aligns with a sense of concern for economic disparities and globalization's impact on national economies, especially considering the political climate that influenced these rankings.It seems that despite geopolitical tensions and trade wars, these massive corporations have still managed to thrive.

However, I can't help but feel that the real issue lies in how these enormous profits are distributed among stakeholders—often times, shareholders reap the benefits while local businesses suffer or are gobbled up by bigger entities.The concentration of wealth in such a small percentage of global companies might not be the most equitable outcome, especially when it comes to fostering healthy competition and economic resilience across nations.

Moreover, the list's creation seems to focus on market value and profits that can easily be influenced by shortterm stock market fluctuations rather than longterm sustainability or contributions to societal welfare.It's a stark reminder of how the corporate world often diverges from the broader social impact it could have if it prioritized community involvement and fair trade practices.

In conclusion, while Forbes' list provides insights into global economic powerhouses, I can't help but feel that there are more nuanced factors at play beyond just market value.We should be more critical of how these companies wield their influence and consider the broader implications on our societies and economies as a whole.",,109,-1,53,400,61.0,-1,

I gotta say, this whole comparing apples and oranges thing is getting old with some folks out there.Sure, Blue Origin popped off a successful test of their New Shepard rocket, which is all well and good for the tech they're working on.But let's not get too caught up in the hype and start comparing it directly to SpaceX's efforts.

First off, these two companies are playing different games here.Blue Origin seems focused on suborbital flights with their New Shepard, while SpaceX is gunning for orbit—and beyond—with their Starship project.It ain't a fair comparison when one company is aiming for the moon and the other is more like taking a hot air balloon ride to the edge of space.

And let's not forget that SpaceX has been doing this reusable rocket thing for a bit longer now, so it's not exactly fair to say they're falling behind just because Blue Origin pulled off a quick win.It takes time, resources, and a whole lot of trial and error to make something like this work.

The space industry is diverse now, sure, but that doesn't mean we gotta start tearing each other down instead of lifting each other up.Both companies have their merits, and it's high time we stop the unnecessary comparisons and just let them do their thing—because when it comes right down to it, we all win in this game.",,114,-1,59,413,62.0,-1,

And here's the kicker comparing reusable rockets like it’s a hot air balloon contest? Please, Blue Origin has yet to prove they can do what SpaceX does on a loop.Reusability isn’t just about one successful flight; it’s about making it work every time, with every mission.

SpaceX isn't falling behind; they're leading the pack and setting a new standard for space travel.The moon? Mars?

So while I agree that we should keep our eyes on the prize, let's not discredit the achievements of other players in this game just because they're not trying to be the loudest on the block.Space exploration isn't a competition where only one team can win; it's about pushing boundaries and advancing human knowledge, no matter how small the step may seem.",,108,60,59,417,,-1,

This article seems to promote a typical corporate view of hiring the best app developers, without much substance or critical analysis about what makes them the top choice.In my opinion, it's just another example of the ProBusiness Establishment narrative that often glosses over the actual quality and value of services offered.

While I appreciate the importance of a robust digital presence in today's marketdriven economy, I find this article's approach to be somewhat lacking.It doesn't provide any tangible evidence or criteria for what makes their app developers exceptional.It seems more like an advertisement than a genuine exploration into the challenges and solutions within software development.The fact that they tout being the top mobile app development agency in Toronto without specifics is just a buzzword meant to attract readers with empty promises.

As someone who values transparency, I believe it's crucial for articles like this one to dive deeper into the methodologies and innovations their developers bring to the table rather than simply stating they are the best.The ProBusiness Establishment often falls short in its rhetoric by neglecting the real innovation that comes from diverse perspectives and competitive markets, not just those with a flashy website or an impressive portfolio of superficially attractive projects.

It's also worth questioning why hiring in Toronto would necessarily mean getting the best developers? There are talented programmers all around the world who might offer better value for money or bring unique skills to the table.This kind of narrow geographic focus seems like a lazy approach to talent acquisition and could potentially overlook exceptional opportunities elsewhere.

In summary, I believe that while there's certainly some merit in hiring experienced professionals from reputable companies, this article falls short by not providing enough critical analysis or depth into what makes these developers stand out.It feels more like an attempt to dominate the search results with a bold claim rather than engaging readers with substantial content.",,107,-1,65,417,49.0,-1,

Some genius philosopher or whatever, and he's got the nerve to tell me about AI surpassing human intelligence? Pfft.

Now, let me get this straight – we're supposed to believe that a computer, which can only do what it's been programmed to do, is gonna just up and become selfaware like some scifi bullshit? Give me a break.I've got more faith in the common sense of your average Joe than in any machine.

And then there's this whole spiel about machines needing values of their own.What the hell does that even mean? We're talking about a chunk of metal and wires, folks.It ain't got no soul, it ain't got no feelings; it's just code on a chip.And you want me to believe it's gonna start caring about humanity and our values? Yeah right.

Bostrom is basically saying that we should be worried about these machines taking over like some kind of dystopian nightmare.I say bring it on, motherfucker.If we can create something that makes our jobs easier, hell yeah we should use it.That's what progress is all about – making life better for the establishment and those who work hard.

On the other hand, I find it concerning when these efforts seem to focus heavily on challenging liberal media outlets while possibly overlooking or downplaying conservative ones' potential flaws.To me, it feels like an imbalance in approach one that could be seen as problematic for the health of our democracy.Every news source needs to be scrutinized, regardless of their political leanings, to ensure we are getting accurate and fair information.

And speaking of oversight, last time I checked, the Federal Reserve wasn't exactly holding a tight leash on the dollar either.So maybe before we start throwing stones at this digital circus, we should take a hard look in our own backyard.Sure, cryptocurrencies are unregulated chaos right now, but they're also unbridled opportunity—something our good old fashioned economy could probably use more of.

So maybe instead of dismissing it outright, we should be figuring out how to tame the beast, or at least not be so quick to write off a potential gamechanger because it makes us uncomfortable.Comfort is for couches, folks.The market is for taking risks and reaping rewards.

And let's not forget—the digital gold rush isn't just about making money; it's also about being early adopters of something that could fundamentally change the way we handle transactions.Sure, there are risks involved, but to dismiss an entire concept outright because most folks are doing it is a bit shortsighted.

So before we all jump off this cliff together, maybe we should be asking ourselves Who's going to profit most from cryptocurrency? And it ain't the little guy holding the bag.It's the innovators and the early birds who aren't afraid to take a chance on something that might just change everything.

The fact that this project is being hosted on Github highlights the elitism inherent in such projects they cater primarily to those who already have access to tech resources and coding skills.It doesn't address the issue of unequal distribution of power, where only those who can code or understand complex software get to shape public discourse.This kind of tool might be seen as democratizing online spaces at first glance, but it really just reinforces the existing digital divide.

I don't buy it.

First off, these AIs aren't learning in the way humans do.They're just good at processing patterns and recognizing trends.It's not like they're sitting there pondering existential questions or anything.And even if they did somehow become as smart as us, what makes you think they'd have the same values or goals? I mean, we're talking about machines here, not humans with hearts and souls.

And don't get me started on this bit about how AI could be the last invention humanity ever needs.What a load of crap! Man's ingenuity knows no bounds, and there'll always be room for improvement, new discoveries, and innovations beyond our current wildest dreams.And besides, what about all those jobs that'll supposedly disappear with automation? That's just great, isn't it?

Bostrom's got this whole gloomanddoom vibe going on like he thinks we're headed for some sort of dystopian future where machines rule the roost.But let me tell you something, buddy – humans are resilient and resourceful.We adapt, we overcome, and we always find a way to keep moving forward.

So yeah, I'm not buying this whole AI's gonna take over schpiel.It’s just too much fearmongering in my opinion.We need to focus on keeping our humanity intact – empathy, compassion, all that jazz – because that's what makes us human.Not some fancy AI or code we can write.

In conclusion, while Bostrom makes some compelling points, his perspective feels somewhat narrow to me.I think we need to focus on developing a more nuanced understanding of how AI can work alongside humans instead of fearing the hypothetical singularity.After all, the future is something that should be shaped by us, not just by our machines.",,91,-1,99,470,38.0,-1,

Nick Bostrom diving into the future of AI and how it might just outsmart us.Now, I've got to say, this perspective doesn't exactly align with my views.You see, when you're on the right side of the political spectrum and I'm not saying I'm on the wrong side, mind you you start thinking about who's really driving these technological advancements.

Bostrom talks about how computers are becoming smarter than us, almost like they've got a mind of their own.But let me tell you something, it ain't Mother Nature or the common folk pushing this forward.It's those in power, the elites you might say, with their fingers deep in the pie, shaping this tech for their gain.

And what does that mean? Well, it means that these smart machines could be programmed to value things differently than we do like those same elites do.Sure, they're talking about values of their own, but who knows what kind of values we're really talking about here? Could be a whole lot of nothing good for the little guy.

So, when Bostrom asks if these smart machines will help keep humanity and our values intact, I say bullshit.We've seen how power corrupts, and it ain't getting any better with technology in the mix.Those in charge will use AI to further their own interests, not ours.It's all about control.

Now, don't get me wrong, I ain't saying we shouldn't be thinking about this stuff.But we gotta make sure that when these machines become smart enough to outdo us, they're working for the people not just some fat cats in a boardroom.That's what it boils down to: who's really calling the shots?",,163,-1,112,487,38.0,-1,
113,"TITLE: Better Motherfucking Website

I gotta say, this article's perspective is about as far left as you can get.It screams establishment, with those seven fucking declarations that sound like they were written by someone who never had to scrape by without a safety net.

Honestly, I find it laughable how the author claims this is an improvement when it feels more like another way for those in power to keep their grip tight.The whole better website seems like just another distraction from what really matters: giving people real agency and not just shiny new tools that still cater to the elite's interests.

I mean, come on, seven declarations? That's some heavyhanded shit right there.It reeks of someone who thinks they can dictate how we think or feel with a few wellchosen phrases – classic elitist move if you ask me.And don't get me started on the fucking part; it's like the author is trying too hard to seem edgy and relatable when really, it just comes off as desperate.

This article might be all about how our website needs a better overhaul, but what we really need is less topdown control and more genuine representation of the people.This feels like another step backwards in that regard, which isn't something I'm cool with at all.",,119,-1,113,490,78.0,-1,
114,"TITLE: EPP Status Codes | What Do They Mean, and Why Should I Know? ICANN

The article attempts to provide information about Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) domain status codes, which are supposed to indicate the status of a domain name registration.Now, I'm no tech whiz, but from my understanding of how things should work, we don't usually need to know this stuff unless we're dealing with some shady online business ourselves.

This perspective doesn't align well with what our values as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives hold dear.We prefer to keep things simple and focus on faith, family, and country.The importance given to such technical details seems a bit off the mark for us.It's like saying we need to know how every cog in a machine works to appreciate its function.

I'm not saying it's useless or unimportant information if you're in the right field, but for someone like me with a high school education level, I'd rather focus on things that make a difference in my everyday life.We have enough stuff to worry about without diving into this kind of technical jargon.",,142,-1,114,495,79.0,-1,
115,"TITLE: Interview with CEO of LBRY | RetroRGB

These leftwing tech geeks and their fanciful blockchainbased projects are just another way to undermine traditional American values.LBRY, with its protocol, is no different from the rest of these Silicon Valley wannabes trying to play god with technology while disrespecting our cherished institutions.

I find it quite amusing how they claim this thing can revolutionize content hosting.As if we need some newfangled method for sharing videos when good old American ingenuity and common sense have served us just fine since the dawn of time.These tech elites think they're above tradition, but history has a way of proving them wrong.

The fact that LBRY is blockchainbased screams libertarian utopia to me, which we all know is just a thinly veiled attempt at masking their real intentions: promoting hedonism and individualism over community values.And what's with these tech folks and their obsession with buzzwords? It's like they're trying too hard to sound important.

The interview also mentions the protocol being used for content hosting. Oh, I get it.They want to replace wellestablished platforms that actually uphold familyfriendly content standards with something that probably caters to degenerate material.Just what we need, more perversity floating around the internet.

And let's not forget about the CEO, Jeremy Kauffman.Probably some ivy leagueeducated elitist who thinks he can change the world with his highfalutin ideas.Newsflash, buddy: this country was built on principles, not on your precious blockchain or whatever it is you're peddling.

I'll keep my skepticism and maintain a healthy distance from these kinds of projects that aim to disrupt our Godgiven order.We don't need some overhyped tech fad telling us how to live our lives when we've been doing just fine with the wisdom passed down by our forefathers.",,37,-1,115,499,80.0,-1,
116,"I'm sorry, but this LBRY business is just another example of those outoftouch elites trying to sell us on their revolutionary tech while ignoring the tried and true methods that have kept America great for centuries.What's next? A blockchainbased flag for our nation? I bet it'd be real popular with the common folk, huh?

And don't get me started on this disrupting the order nonsense.Our forefathers didn't build this country by being disruptive; they built it on hard work and integrity, not some Silicon Valley playboy's getrichquick scheme.

I'm all for progress, but let's make sure it's progress that makes sense and benefits everyone, not just a handful of techies who think they can outsmart thousands of years of human civilization with their fancy protocols.",,137,115,115,502,,-1,
117,"Oh, please.Because our forefathers didn't use revolutionary technology to build this country? Silly shit like railroads and telegraphs sure as hell disrupted the status quo, and not a single one of them cried about it.LBRY is just the next step in that tradition, whether you like it or not.",,49,115,115,502,,-1,
118,"TITLE: Babylon Bee | Fake News You Can Trust

I've taken a look at this article that claims to be fake news you can trust from Babylon Bee, and my first thought is what kind of game are they playing here? On the surface, it seems like a satirical take on the current media landscape, which I could see being appealing to some.However, as someone who values truth in reporting, this concept rubs me the wrong way.

From an AntiElite perspective, one would expect a healthy dose of skepticism towards mainstream news sources.But Babylon Bee's approach feels like it's poking fun at the very idea of seeking genuine information.It plays on the public's frustration with fake news while simultaneously undermining trust in any source that aims to provide accurate information.

While I understand the intent behind satire, I can't help but feel that this kind of content only serves to further confuse an already skeptical audience.If we're looking for trustworthy sources, why would we turn to a site that admits to publishing false reports? It's a paradoxical approach that might entertain some people, but it doesn't contribute positively to the discourse.

In conclusion, while I see where Babylon Bee is coming from with their selfdescription as fake news you can trust, I believe this kind of content does more harm than good.We should strive for reliable sources of information rather than embracing outlets that play on our cynicism about the media.",,11,-1,118,503,81.0,-1,
119,"@JamesJones You're absolutely clueless if you think LBRY's just another step in some grand American tradition.It's more like these tech elitists are trying to sell us a futuristic car when we've been perfectly happy with our horse and buggy.Disrupting the status quo isn't always such a bad thing, especially when it means not having to deal with the shitheads who think they can control what content we see.",,84,115,115,504,,-1,
120,"Honestly, folks, are we really falling for this? Cynthia drops truth bombs on all sides with such grace and precision that I'm left wondering if anyone actually listens.We're talking about Lessig's free culture like it's some kind of mythical beast threatening our capitalist haven.Let me spell it out the real beast here is complacency, the kind that feeds off stagnation while wearing a mask of progress.

And don't even get me started on this notion of accountability.It seems we're playing a game where one side holds all the cards, and the other pretends they're not being played.We need to wake up from this dream where sharing crumbs is enough to earn our blessing.It's time to call out those who wear their selfinterest like a badge of honor.

The marketplace might be a place of pragmatism for some, but let's not forget it's also the breeding ground for monopolies and power dynamics that Leslie so astutely pointed out.We're not asking for absolute freedom; we're demanding transparency and genuine action from those who've made a fortune off our collective creativity.

So, to those preaching about free culture while their hands are deep in the pockets of corporatocracy, I say keep dreaming of accountability if it makes you sleep better at night.But remember, sweet dreams don't feed the hungry; progress demands more than just words and PR stunts.",,165,104,100,505,,-1,
121,"TITLE: Thread Reader App

Well, I guess someone thought it'd be a good idea to create an app that aggregates Twitter threads.Now, let's think this through.On one hand, it could make navigating through those long chains of tweets a little easier for some folks.But honestly, who the fuck wants to read a bunch of tiny text on their phones? It's not like we're short on screens these days.

As someone who prefers substance over form, I can see the appeal for the techsavvy crowd.However, from a practical standpoint, does anyone really need help finding good content on Twitter? That platform is like a treasure trove of shit, and now you want to organize it? Sure, there might be some usecase scenarios where this could be helpful, but I think it's just another unnecessary layer of complication in an already convoluted social media landscape.

And here's the kicker making money from ads based on people's reading habits.That sounds like a recipe for disaster if you ask me.How many times do we have to see targeted ads before we realize that our every move online is being tracked and used against us? I'm not buying what these folks are selling, even if it means I miss out on some supposed golden threads of Twitter wisdom.

In conclusion, Thread Reader might be a neat tool for some, but for me, it's just another example of how detached from reality the tech world is getting.We're creating solutions to problems that don't exist, and in doing so, we're forgetting what really matters.",,126,-1,121,506,82.0,-1,
122,"TITLE: You Won’t Be Able to Disable (or Delay) Windows Updates on Windows 10 Home

Well, isn't that just peachy? Microsoft decides to go all big brother on us with their latest move to forcefeed us constant updates for Windows 10 Home.I guess they think we're all a bunch of techilliterate sheep who can't be trusted to run our own computers without constant babysitting.

I find this whole idea pretty fucking insulting, if you ask me.It's like they don't trust us to make sensible decisions about when and what to update on our systems.I mean, come on! Who the fuck does Microsoft think they are? My computer is my domain, not theirs.If I want to delay an update for a few days or weeks because it might mess with some software that I use for work, then that's my prerogative.

I'm no tech genius, but even I can see the potential pitfalls of constant updates.What if something goes wrong? What if an update breaks some critical functionality? Who's going to fix it at 2 am when I need my computer to get shit done? Not Microsoft, that's for fucking sure.

This move reeks of elitism and control.It's like they're saying, We know better than you, so we'll just force our will onto your system. And that, my friends, is exactly why people are getting fed up with these big tech companies.They think they can just steamroll over us because they have the power? Hell no.

So, Microsoft, listen the fuck up: I'm not gonna stand for this kind of shit.I'll find ways to work around your fucking updates if that's what it takes.And I'm sure as hell not the only one.You're pushing people into the arms of alternative operating systems, and you know what? Good fucking riddance.

I guess in the end, we'll see how this plays out.But mark my words, Microsoft, you're making a lot of enemies with this move.And I'm just happy to be part of that resistance.",,171,-1,122,507,83.0,-1,

These big tech giants can't catch a break.They're so caught up in their own highandmighty world that they forgot about the little things like fair play and honest business practices.These companies are like a boys' club where everyone agrees not to poach each other's talent, keeping wages low to maintain the status quo.

I don't see how anyone can justify this behavior when we're talking about some of the wealthiest corporations on the planet.It's just another example of how outoftouch these tech moguls are.They act as if they're doing everyone a favor by paying their employees well, but really, it's just the right thing to do.

I'm no fan of unions or government intervention in business, but this is different.This is about basic fairness and respect for workers who create the value for these companies.It's time for them to face the music and pay the piper instead of trying to silence everyone with their lawyers and deep pockets.The trial should be a wakeup call for all of them that they can't keep treating their employees like secondclass citizens without consequences.

I'm happy to see this getting attention because it's not just about these companies; it reflects on the entire tech industry and its treatment of workers.It needs more scrutiny, and I hope the trial sheds some muchneeded light on this issue.",,166,-1,123,508,43.0,-1,

And let me guess, when someone suggests sharing crumbs, you're too busy plotting how to grab more for yourself? I'm not falling for this charade.The real threat isn't free culture; it's people like you who can't see past their own noses.Keep dreaming of accountability while your own house burns down around you – that’s the true face of progress, ain’t it?",,92,120,100,508,,-1,
125,"TITLE: Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk

Well, this talk from some philosopher guy named Nick Bostrom is an interesting topic.He's all worried about AI getting too smart for humans and taking over or something.I guess it's a valid concern, but I don't buy into all the doom and gloom.We've been hearing scary stories about technology since the dawn of time.

Bostrom thinks that once AI surpasses human intelligence, we'll pretty much be screwed unless we can somehow preserve our humanity and values or whatever.I mean, who cares if machines are smarter than us? They're just tools at the end of the day.As long as they keep making money for business owners, I'm all in.

I think Bostrom is overthinking it.We've always been able to adapt to new technology and turn it into a profit.Plus, we'll probably find a way to control these smart machines before they get too out of hand.It's not like humans can't handle a bit of competition for the top spot.

But hey, what do I know? Maybe this guy Bostrom is onto something.Still doesn't change my view on using technology to make more money and grow as a society.",,2,-1,125,509,38.0,-1,

Well, I've got some thoughts on this TED talk stuff.First off, the whole idea that these computer nerds think they can create something that's gonna be as smart as us humans is pretty damn laughable.I mean, come on, who the hell does Bostrom think he is? Some genius philosopher or whatever, and he's got the nerve to tell me about AI surpassing human intelligence? Pfft.

Now, let me get this straight – we're supposed to believe that a computer, which can only do what it's been programmed to do, is gonna just up and become selfaware like some scifi bullshit? Give me a break.I've got more faith in the common sense of your average Joe than in any machine.

And then there's this whole spiel about machines needing values of their own.What the hell does that even mean? We're talking about a chunk of metal and wires, folks.It ain't got no soul, it ain't got no feelings; it's just code on a chip.And you want me to believe it's gonna start caring about humanity and our values? Yeah right.

Bostrom is basically saying that we should be worried about these machines taking over like some kind of dystopian nightmare.I say bring it on, motherfucker.If we can create something that makes our jobs easier, hell yeah we should use it.That's what progress is all about – making life better for the establishment and those who work hard.

And let me guess, Bostrom's gonna tell us to be scared of this overwhelming machine intelligence? I ain't buying it.We've been dealing with technology advancements every day; we're not a bunch of scaredycats hiding in the dark waiting for some AI boogeyman.Bring on the smart machines – they might just save our bacon.

So, to sum it all up, this Nick Bostrom guy can take his TED talk and shove it where the sun don't shine.I ain't buying into any of his fearmongering bullshit.We're not gonna cower before some machine that supposedly has more intelligence than us humans.That's just plain stupid.",,94,-1,126,512,38.0,-1,

Let me tell you something about these socalled advanced AI systems everyone's raving about.I've spent countless hours studying and experimenting with them, and guess what? They're fucking useless! At best, they're like a glorified autocomplete feature for basic tasks.Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying there's no potential here, but it's all just hype to make you think these systems are more intelligent than they really are.

The truth is, AI can't replace human intuition and critical thinking.These systems are built on complex algorithms that make them great at pattern recognition, but when it comes to creative problemsolving or understanding the world beyond data, they fall flat on their face.It's like expecting a parrot to write Shakespearean sonnets.

And don't get me started on how these companies are pushing their AI agenda onto us through every platform imaginable.They're using your data against you, manipulating your perceptions and feeding you lies that there's some magic in the machines that'll solve all our problems if we just let it.

I'm not buying it anymore.It's time to wake up and see these tech giants for what they are manipulative assholes trying to control every aspect of our lives with their socalled innovations.

I've been digging into this Big Tech bullshit for years now, and what I see is a bunch of elitist assholes using their power to shape the future in ways we can't even begin to comprehend.They're turning AI into their personal playthings, deciding who gets to work for them, who gets to use their products, and ultimately, who gets left behind.

And let's not forget about the surveillance state they've created! These tech companies are fucking stalking us with their algorithms, selling our data to the highest bidder, and shaping public opinion in ways that benefit only themselves.It's a fucking nightmare, and we need to wake up before it's too late.

These interviews, supposedly fascinating, are nothing but a distraction from the true values we should focus on as upstanding citizens.The notion that people read Playboy for its articles is comical at best; it's a ragstoriches attempt to validate what's essentially trash.

While I acknowledge that these interviews can provide some insight into the minds of influential figures, they also perpetuate a culture that diminishes the importance of family values and moral integrity.It's no secret that Playboy has long been associated with the seedier side of life, and for good reason.The fact that such interviews are considered fascinating is troubling.

Playboy seems to relish in celebrating individuals who often defy traditional norms, which contradicts the principles we hold dear as a community.It's like watching a soap opera; it may be intriguing on the surface but ultimately leaves you feeling soiled and questioning your judgement for indulging in such nonsense.

Perhaps what I find most disheartening is that these interviews are given any attention at all.Instead of celebrating those who uphold our core values, we're fed stories about individuals who live life contrary to them.Playboy may have found fame by objectifying women, but it's not a legacy worth lauding.It's a legacy that undermines the very fabric of what makes us strong and respectable.

These experts probably think they've got some deep understanding of electricity.

It's all about playing on people's fears, you know?

I find it intriguing how the article touts Bitchute as a platform that puts creators first, all while emphasizing freedom and privacy for users.While I appreciate the sentiment of supporting creators' rights and user freedoms, I can't help but wonder if this site truly aligns with our shared values.As someone who cherishes traditional American principles, it's important to me that any online community not only respects these ideals but actively promotes them.

In my view, Bitchute's focus on creator sovereignty might inadvertently create an environment where certain content is prioritized over others, potentially straying from the balanced exchange of ideas that I believe is crucial for a healthy society.Furthermore, while privacy and freedom are essential, they must be balanced with responsibility and accountability to ensure that these freedoms aren't abused.

The article doesn't provide concrete evidence or specific examples of how Bitchute actively champions these values beyond promoting its platform, which raises my skepticism about the validity of its claims.As a user who seeks information from various angles, I'd like to see more substance about how Bitchute ensures that its commitment to freedom and privacy extends across all content and interactions on the site.

134,"TITLE: The Silent Revolution: How AI is Reshaping Software Development

In the quiet corners of the tech world, something big is brewing.It's not the flashy stuff that gets all the attention – no, I'm talking about the way Artificial Intelligence (AI) is silently revolutionizing software development.As someone who's been in the coding scene for years and identifies as AntiElite Populist Right, I've seen firsthand how traditional methods of programming are becoming outdated.

The mainstream narrative often glosses over this shift, focusing instead on the fearmongering surrounding AI replacing human jobs.But what if, instead of fearing AI, we embraced it? What if we could use AI to augment our skills, making us more efficient and effective developers?

Take for instance, AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or Tabnine.These tools can write code snippets as you type, suggesting entire functions with just a few keystrokes.It's not about replacing human programmers but empowering them to focus on what they do best: creating innovative solutions.

The argument against AIassisted programming often comes from those who cling to the pure way of coding – the notion that real programmers don't need any help, thank you very much.But this kind of thinking is holding us back.By dismissing AI as a crutch or a shortcut, we're missing out on an opportunity to elevate our skills and tackle complex problems more efficiently.

It's time for us to rethink how we approach software development.Let's embrace the tools that can help us work smarter, not harder.After all, progress isn't about being antitechnology; it's about being pragmatic and forwardthinking.So let's talk about this – what do you think is holding back the adoption of AI in your own coding practices?",,163,-1,134,521,,-1,

That's an exaggeration even for the most sensationalist tabloid.

You mention these fancy AI coding assistants, but what's next? Next thing you know, we'll have AIs doing all the thinking for us.Now, I know that sounds like a joke, but humor me when do we draw the line on how much help we're willing to accept from machines?

I gotta say, this whole Sentinel Playground idea sounds like the tech equivalent of a kid's playroom—probably made by someone who thinks they're still playing Minecraft but can't tell the difference between virtual and real life.Don't get me wrong, I'm all for exploring and discovering new things about our Earth through satellite imagery, but calling it a playground? It sounds like we're treating data like toys.

Now, let's talk about this Sentinel Hub technology they're pushing.As someone who values practicality above all else, I have to question why we need a graphical interface for something as seemingly straightforward as satellite imaging.Is it that hard to just look at the raw data? And what's with the constant emphasis on fullresolution? What normal person is going to sit down and examine fullresolution images of Sentinel1 or Sentinel2? It sounds like overkill to me.

And then there's this huge archive they're talking about.A massive resource for anyone interested in Earth’s changing surface, huh? Well, I'm not too sure about that.If you ask me, most people wouldn't give two shits about the daily changes on Earth unless it directly affects them or their pocketbooks.But hey, let's keep throwing money at this Sentinel Playground and hope it becomes some sort of magical portal to knowledge.

In conclusion, while I can appreciate the ambition behind Sentinel Hub, I think we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves here.We need to focus on what truly matters: practical applications that benefit our community and country, not flashy names or interfaces that make us forget about the real issues at hand.And let's be honest, calling it a playground is just another example of how disconnected from reality some tech folks can get.",,85,-1,139,526,87.0,-1,

In my opinion, while having good WiFi coverage can be convenient, there are far more important things to invest time and resources into.I believe we should prioritize addressing systemic issues such as wealth inequality, job security, and access to healthcare rather than worrying about optimizing our wireless networks.It's another example of the elite trying to manipulate public perception and divert attention away from what really matters.

I've been delving into the world of decentralized data storage and I gotta say, it's something that really aligns with my views as an AntiElite Populist Right individual.Centralized systems, whether in tech or politics, tend to create power imbalances that can lead to exploitation by those in control.

We see this with big tech companies hoarding our data and using it for their own gain, much like how governments centralize power to maintain their grip on society.Decentralizing data means the power isn't concentrated in one place, which reduces the risk of corruption and abuse.

There are some here who might argue that decentralized systems are more chaotic or harder to manage.I get those concerns, but isn't a little chaos worth it if it keeps us free? I think decentralization is about giving back control to the people where it belongs, much like we want in our political system.

While it's true that some people might enjoy such activities for entertainment or as a way to make ends meet, the promotion of betting websites can be seen as encouraging dependency on external sources of income rather than fostering selfsufficiency.Furthermore, issues like gambling addiction and unequal wealth distribution are significant concerns that need to be addressed.

Moreover, I find it concerning how the summary focuses solely on the entertainment aspects without mentioning any potential risks or responsibilities associated with such activities.It seems to lack a balanced view by not discussing the broader implications of participating in these kinds of platforms.

I gotta say, I'm a bit puzzled by this whole situation.We have these kernel.org servers getting rooted two years ago that's some serious business! And here we are, still trying to figure out what happened and why? It sounds like there might be some bureaucratic red tape and lack of transparency at play here.

It's not exactly reassuring for those of us who care about protecting our country from potential digital threats.

In my humble opinion, we should be pushing harder for answers and accountability here.This isn't something that should be swept under the rug or left unexplained, especially given its implications for national security.We need to make sure our digital infrastructure is safe and secure, and that starts with getting to the bottom of incidents like this.

As someone who values traditional methods and principles, particularly within financial systems, cryptocurrencies seem to contradict these beliefs.The idea of decentralized transactions without the oversight of central authorities like banks is concerning for several reasons that align with my conservative viewpoints.The lack of regulation and accountability increases the risk of fraudulent activities and undermines the stability of our current economic system.

Moreover, I find it ironic how a publication like Home Magazine would focus on something as volatile and unpredictable as cryptocurrencies.It's almost as if they're trying to redefine what home means in today's uncertain world – a place where one might feel secure is now a concept up for grabs, much like the value of these digital currencies.

The article seems to gloss over the potential risks associated with cryptocurrencies, which I believe is a significant oversight.It's crucial to consider not just the benefits but also the downsides that could impact everyday people who may be lured into this speculative market without understanding its intricacies.

It's almost as if folks like Bostrom think humans can't handle progress or something.

And then there's this whole thing about AI having its own set of values, which is just plain scary to him.Why would we want to create a smart machine that doesn't give two shits about human values, right? It's almost like he thinks machines are inherently evil or something.What kind of nonsense is that?

Bostrom also says we won't need to make another invention ever again because AI will save the day.Oh, really now? I guess all our problems just solved itself with a few lines of code huh? That's some magical thinking right there.

This talk seems more like an elitist fearmongering session than anything else.Bostrom is basically saying that we're all gonna be replaced by machines and it might not even matter if the world ends because, you know, AI will fix everything.It's this whole we're doomed unless we get really smart stuff narrative that I ain't buying into.

I'm no expert in philosophy or tech, but it seems to me like Bostrom is just stirring up controversy for the sake of attention.And if you ask me, there are far more pressing issues we should be focusing on than whether our machines might turn evil someday.

I came across this article with interest, considering its focus on debate tactics.However, I find myself slightly disappointed that the piece doesn't explicitly align with my views as someone who values constructive yet firm dialogue rooted in solid principles.

The author, having an educational background from Harvard Business School, presents a perspective that's seemingly neutral about what constitutes intellectually honest debate.While I appreciate the openness to learning and testing theories, I feel the article lacks a clear stance on the importance of moral foundations and the critical role of values in shaping our arguments.As someone who believes in the power of principles over mere facts, I miss a deeper dive into how these underpin every discussion.

In my experience, particularly within conservative circles, it's essential to acknowledge that debate isn't just about presenting facts or even being academically rigorous but also about upholding truth rooted in moral integrity.This aspect feels somewhat missing from the article, leading me to wonder if there's a risk of straying into intellectually dishonest territory without these guiding principles.

Now, I'm no expert, but using thug to describe violent protestors doesn't come off as particularly mysterious or complex to me.It's a term that's been around for ages and usually implies someone who uses force or intimidation – something those rioters were doing, no question about it.

McWhorter goes on to say how we need to be careful with our language because words like thug carry heavy histories and can stir up negative emotions.But I'd argue that the real issue isn't the word itself, but what those people are actually doing – breaking windows, starting fires, looting stores.The professor seems more focused on the semantics than the reality of the situation.

And here's where NPR really loses me: by framing this discussion as if it's a problem with our language rather than a reflection of the actions taken by these rioters, they're sidestepping the real issue at hand – accountability for destructive behavior.It feels like another attempt to shift the focus away from what those people were doing and onto how we refer to them.

In my view, this NPR piece is more about stirring up race relations than addressing the actual problem.We've got a bunch of folks in Baltimore causing chaos, and instead of talking about that, we're discussing etymology? It's like they want us to forget what really matters – justice for those communities, not just sympathetic words from an Ivy League professor.

The author of this piece must be living under a rock not to acknowledge the countless accidents caused by these dumb machines.It's one thing to write a parable that sells well, but it's another entirely to promote such naive optimism about technology.

And what's with all these mayhem of humans anyway? As if we're the problem here! I believe it's high time these technocrats realized that there's no app or algorithm in the world that can account for every possible human behavior on the road.It's just a matter of time before one of these selfdriving cars takes an innocent life, and then where will all these dreamers be? Hiding behind their screens, I bet.

Well, this article seems to be about a free implementation of Google Play Services for Android devices.I must say, it's an interesting concept but raises some concerns from my perspective.The idea that someone is working on a free alternative to something that Google offers as part of their Play Store ecosystem is commendable, yet it feels like they're trying to undermine Google's business model.

As a supporter of established businesses and their practices, I'm wary about projects like this one.It's not that I don't appreciate the effort put into creating alternatives; in fact, competition can be good for consumers.However, when something is offered for free, especially by an independent group rather than a large corporation, it often comes with strings attached or lacks proper support.

In this case, using microg/GmsCore means you're depending on an opensource project for your Play Services implementation.While opensource can be great for innovation and learning, it also means there's no guarantee of stability or security updates without the contribution and commitment of the community.This could potentially create vulnerabilities in devices that rely on these services.

Furthermore, if more people start using microg/GmsCore instead of the official Google Play Services, it might harm Android device manufacturers who have partnerships with Google.These partnerships often require adherence to certain standards or guidelines, which benefits both parties and ensures a smoother user experience.By opting for an alternative that's not backed by a major tech giant like Google, users might miss out on these benefits.

So while I appreciate the spirit of innovation and competition behind microg/GmsCore, I do have reservations about its longterm implications.It could be seen as disrupting the delicate balance between established businesses and the opensource community, which is something I'm cautious about supporting.",,30,-1,245,604,119.0,-1,

I've been experimenting with different coding assistants and tools lately, but one thing that really caught my eye was vibe coding.There's something special about using AI to not only generate code for you, but also understand the creative side of programming.

The mainstream view seems to be focused on speed and efficiency when it comes to coding, but I believe there's a lot more to consider.The soulless, generic solutions that big tech pushes just don't cut it anymore.It's time we move towards something more personal and adaptable like vibe coding.

I've seen a lot of people criticize this approach as too easy or not challenging. But what is wrong with making things easier for everyone? Isn't the goal to create software that is accessible to all, not just techsavvy elitists?

Some might argue that we should stick to traditional methods and keep everything rigidly structured.I say fuck that it's time to embrace something new and exciting.The world is changing fast, and if you don't adapt, you're left behind.

While I understand the skepticism, I truly believe that vibe coding has the potential to revolutionize programming.It's not just about generating lines of code; it's about creating a more enjoyable, creative experience.And who doesn't want that in their work?

So come on, people! Let's stop being elitist snobs and embrace the future.The world is ready for vibe coding, and I bet you will be too once you give it a shot.",,35,-1,246,605,,-1,

The article seems to present a lighthearted, satirical commentary on economic conditions and corporate practices.While it's amusing in its delivery, the perspective it presents doesn't quite align with my views as someone who leans towards ProBusiness Establishment Right.

In these kinds of comics, there often tends to be an underlying assumption that corporations are inherently evil or that capitalism, by itself, is a zerosum game where one person's gain must equal another's loss.This couldn’t be further from what I believe in.

From my viewpoint, healthy economic growth and the success of big business can actually benefit society as a whole.Corporations drive innovation, provide jobs, and are often the backbone of our economy.What I find missing in such satirical commentary is an understanding of the positive contributions businesses make when they operate efficiently and responsibly within the framework of free markets.

While humor can be a powerful tool to highlight issues, it's important not to oversimplify complex realities.The economic world isn't just about greedy corporations versus the little guy; there are success stories of individual entrepreneurs and large companies alike that have revolutionized industries for the better.

But here's where Bitchute might just cross the line: by saying it champions users' freedoms and privacy, aren't they flirting with the idea of creating an echo chamber or a hotbed for all sorts of dangerous content? I mean, we ReligiousPatriot Conservatives value freedom of speech as much as the next person, but we ain't naive.We know that without proper guidance, too much of it can lead to chaos and harm.

And let's not get started on this prioritizing creators bit.Sure, folks making videos deserve a fair shake, but if Bitchute leans too heavily in their favor, might they inadvertently create an environment where users' rights take a backseat? That doesn't sit well with us.We want balance equal protection for all, no special treatment based on who's creating what.

So, while my initial reaction is intrigued by the promise of more freedom and privacy, I gotta keep a close eye on Bitchute.If they start swaying too far from respecting everyone's rights, then I'm afraid they might find themselves in hot water with folks like me.We ReligiousPatriot Conservatives ain't about to let anyone mess with our values without a fight.",,90,-1,284,622,86.0,-1,

It seems we have a situation where one man is pointing fingers at another regarding the collapse of an enterprise.This kind of infighting often reflects poorly on all parties involved and can lead to a messy fallout.The fact that Kondik wants to distance himself from the company suggests that there are deeper issues at play, possibly rooted in poor leadership or decisionmaking.

My concern is not so much with who's at fault here but rather how this affects the community that relies on CyanogenMod for their devices.It's crucial for such projects to remain stable and secure, regardless of what happens behind closed doors.The reorganization hinted at suggests an attempt to salvage what can be saved, which in itself is a positive development.

However, we must tread carefully here.Legal entanglements are no joke, especially when mixing opensource endeavors with forprofit ventures.It's like trying to untangle two different snakes—one that thrives on community involvement and the other driven by profit.The latter often seeks control while the former values freedom.

289,"TITLE: Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk

In this TED Talk discussion, Nick Bostrom presents an intriguing perspective on the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence.His assertion that a computer AI could match human intelligence within the current century and potentially overtake us is thoughtprovoking.As someone who values traditional conservative principles and the importance of religious beliefs in shaping societal norms, I find myself questioning some aspects of Bostrom's argument.

Firstly, while it's true that technological advancements are reshaping our world at an unprecedented pace, I'm concerned about the potential consequences of unchecked AI development.From a ReligiousPatriot Conservative standpoint, we place significant emphasis on the role of human values and moral frameworks in guiding societal progress.The idea of machines having their own set of values raises red flags; it challenges the established order and the very essence of what makes us human.

Secondly, Bostrom's statement that machine intelligence is the last invention humanity will ever need to make seems overly optimistic or even hubristic.As someone who believes in God's plan for humanity, I find this assertion troubling.Our faith teaches us that it is through our relationships with each other and with the divine that we find purpose and fulfillment, not through technological superiority.

Moreover, there's a risk of societal disruption when machines surpass human intelligence.Our society has long been built on principles of democracy, community, and human compassion values that are rooted in our shared humanity.If AI were to develop its own set of values, it could potentially undermine these foundations and create an unrecognizable world.

In conclusion, while Bostrom's ideas provide a fascinating exploration of the potential future, they seem to overlook some crucial aspects.From my perspective, it is vital that we proceed with caution in our pursuit of technological advancement, ensuring that we don't lose sight of what truly matters: our humanity, our values, and our connection to something greater than ourselves.

It's almost like he thinks machines are inherently evil or something.What kind of nonsense is that?

Bostrom also says we won't need to make another invention ever again because AI will save the day.Oh, really now? I guess all our problems just solved itself with a few lines of code huh? That's some magical thinking right there.

First off, let me say that I'm not impressed by these socalled top app developers.I mean, what does that even mean? They probably just pay some intern to slap together an app with shit code and call it a day.And then they charge clients an arm and a leg for the privilege of using their mediocre work.

And don't get me started on how they claim to offer best solutions.Best for who, I wonder? Definitely not for the small businesses or independent developers trying to make a living in this industry.It's all just a bunch of tech elites sitting around patting each other on the back, thinking they're above everyone else.

If I had a nickel for every time some top app developer told me that their way was the only right way, I'd be a rich man.But we all know how that goes: the minute you think you've reached the top, there's always someone else ready to swoop in and steal your spot.

310,"TITLE: Google Has Finally Killed the CAPTCHA

Google's decision to kill the CAPTCHA system might seem like a victory for convenience, but I see it as another step towards relinquishing our privacy and security.This move aligns with the center's belief in technological advancement without considering the consequences of such progress.

CAPTCHAs were annoying, sure, but they served a purpose: to distinguish real humans from bots.By removing them, Google is essentially opening the door for automated systems to take over, potentially leading to increased spam and hacking attempts on various websites.It's like giving free rein to the digital equivalent of an unchecked mob.

Furthermore, this decision showcases a lack of concern regarding data privacy.How will users know what data they're sharing or how it's being used when there are no more CAPTCHAs? This move feels like Google is prioritizing ease over caution, and that worries me.The center might see it as progress, but I believe we should be more vigilant.

In essence, while the end of CAPTCHA may bring shortterm relief, it could lead to longterm problems for internet security and privacy.It's a classic case of the blind leading the blind towards a future where our online safety is at risk.",,283,-1,310,634,131.0,-1,

312,"TITLE: The Imperative of Anonymity Who Is McAfee?

In today's digital age, questions about privacy and anonymity have become more relevant than ever.Ross Ulbricht's case is a stark reminder of the consequences when individuals seek to remain anonymous online, creating platforms that operate outside traditional societal norms.While some may view his actions as a form of rebellion against oppressive systems, others could argue that they are harmful and deserving of severe punishment.

As someone who values individual freedom and autonomy above all else, I find it concerning how easily those freedoms can be taken away based on the perception of wrongdoing in the digital realm.McAfee, as a figure embroiled in controversy and accusations, raises more questions than answers regarding the balance between security measures and personal privacy.The imperative of anonymity is significant because it speaks to the heart of who we are as individuals our ability to make choices without unwarranted surveillance or interference.

Yet, the argument can be made that figures like Ulbricht exploit these freedoms for nefarious purposes.This dichotomy reflects a broader societal issue: how do we protect individual rights while ensuring harm does not come to others? McAfee's involvement in the tech world and their association with individuals like Ulbricht highlight the complexities of anonymity and freedom.

In conclusion, while I understand the importance of privacy and anonymity in today's society, it is also crucial that we acknowledge when these principles are used for harmful intentions.The case of Ross Ulbricht and figures associated with McAfee serves as a cautionary tale about the fine line between protecting individual liberties and perpetuating criminal activities.",,283,-1,312,636,132.0,-1,

As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I firmly believe in the importance of adapting to technological advancements while staying true to our values.After exploring various AI coding assistants, I'm convinced that vibe coding is not just a trend but a crucial step forward.This approach combines human intuition and creativity with AI's computational prowess, resulting in more efficient and effective problemsolving.

I understand some might be concerned about relying on technology for coding, fearing it could replace the human touch entirely.However, I see vibe coding as a way to augment our capabilities rather than diminish them.By learning to code alongside AI systems, we can focus on what truly matters—solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions that align with our conservative principles.

Alright, let me get this straight.We've got a guy named Vincent James who's out there calling himself The Red Elephants. First off, I'm not quite sure what that's supposed to mean – are we talking about political leanings or something else entirely? But here's my two cents on it: as someone who values strong traditional family structures and national pride, I find it downright confusing when folks like Vincent James jump around from topic to topic without a clear direction.

Now, I'm not saying that being adaptable is bad.Heck, life changes, and so should our beliefs to some extent.But there's something about this guy's approach that just leaves me scratching my head.It seems like he's trying to cover all his bases instead of really digging deep into anything.And let's be real here – if you're going to call yourself The Red Elephants, you better have something substantial to offer, not just a mixed bag of opinions.

As for the political leanings I'm supposed to align with, well, let's just say that I believe in good oldfashioned conservative values: hard work ethic, strong family bonds, and having pride in our country.It's disheartening when people who identify as conservatives seem more focused on their own personal brand than actually standing for something meaningful.

So, Vincent James, if you're listening – and whether or not you are, because this is just my honest opinion – I think you'd be better off finding a specific niche to really sink your teeth into instead of spreading yourself so thin.We need fewer Red Elephants who don't quite know what they stand for and more people out there who can authentically represent the values that truly matter to this great nation.

I gotta say, this article's perspective is a bit out there.The idea that Africans have a high average IQ of 70 just doesn't sit right with me.I've seen some research suggesting that the whole notion of grouping an entire continent's population by their IQ is pretty narrowminded.

First off, IQ isn't everything.It's one tool to measure cognitive ability, but it don't tell you much about a person's character or problemsolving skills in realworld situations.And secondly, there's so much diversity across the African continent that I can't shake the feeling this article is painting with too broad of a brush.

It feels like they're trying to fit a square peg into a round hole here.IQ scores vary widely due to factors like education, socioeconomic status, and access to resources.So, for someone to claim an average IQ of 70 for all Africans seems downright silly to me.It's like they're ignoring the vast individual differences within any population.

Microsoft's claim that consumers will act as guinea pigs for testing Windows 10 updates is a classic case of passing the buck to endusers.In my view, this approach undermines the trust and reliability businesses expect from a product like Windows.

While I understand Microsoft's aim to ensure the quality of its updates, it seems unjustifiable to shift the responsibility of identifying potential issues to the average consumer.Consumers are not tech experts; they rely on software being robust and secure without expecting to become part of the testing process.It is the job of a major corporation like Microsoft to deliver a polished product from the start.

This strategy might work in theory, but its practical implementation could lead to frustration among consumers who encounter bugs and problems.It also risks damaging Microsoft's relationship with its business customers, who may perceive this as an unreliable approach to software development.

Microsoft should focus on creating a seamless user experience for both consumers and businesses.The company needs to invest more time in rigorous testing before releasing updates instead of depending on consumer feedback.This shift in responsibility not only affects the company’s reputation but also raises questions about their commitment to producing highquality, businessready products.",,170,-1,318,641,89.0,-1,

The article revealed by WikiLeaks on the secret TPP agreement's IP chapter has raised some eyebrows, and for good reason.As someone who believes in fostering a probusiness environment where trade and commerce can thrive without unnecessary restrictions, I find certain aspects of this leaked document concerning.

First off, it's clear that the perspective presented in this article aligns with a more centertoleft political stance, which contrasts with my own leaning as ProBusiness Establishment Right.The concerns raised about corporate control over policies and the potential stifling of innovation due to strict IP protections don't sit well with me.In my view, fostering an environment where businesses can innovate freely is paramount for economic growth.

While I understand the importance of intellectual property rights in encouraging creativity and development, I worry that this chapter may inadvertently create monopolies or limit competition.As someone who believes in a strong, competitive market system, I think it's essential to strike a balance between protecting IP and ensuring that free trade remains unimpeded.

Moreover, the way this information has been presented by WikiLeaks, which can be seen as an attempt to undermine international business agreements without considering the longterm effects on economies and global markets, leaves me skeptical.The lack of transparency surrounding these trade negotiations is concerning, but I'm not sure if releasing them in their entirety through a leak is the right approach.

In conclusion, while the intentions behind this leak may have been noble from an anticorporatist standpoint, as someone who believes in supporting business interests and promoting economic growth, I see potential pitfalls with the IP chapter of the TPP.It's crucial to ensure that we don't inadvertently stifle innovation or hinder global trade by implementing overly restrictive IP policies.",,152,-1,321,643,134.0,-1,

It's fascinating yet unsettling to consider the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence, as Nick Bostrom points out.While I appreciate his thoughtprovoking talk, it does challenge some of my deeply held beliefs.As a conservative who values tradition and faith, I often worry about the implications of AI surpassing human intellect.

Bostrom's perspective seems to lean toward a neutral or even slightly proAI stance, which is somewhat at odds with my own views as someone who appreciates order and control over technological change.While he raises valid points about the potential for AI to solve many global problems, I can't help but feel a sense of unease when considering an AI's values potentially diverging from human ones.

Well, well, well, if it isn't the latest expert in town claiming to be a DeZOGging specialist.Let me tell you something about this socalled specialist, folks.Patrick Little seems to have more hot air than actual substance when it comes to his claims of debunking the elites and their hidden agendas.

First off, we need to talk about who exactly is Patrick Little? Not much is known about him besides some cryptic email address and a website called Memory Hole, which, in this day and age, screams conspiracy theorist with a capital C. Now, I'm no fan of the elites or mainstream media, but there's something fishy about someone claiming to be a DeZOGging specialist without any real credentials or background information.

Let's break it down: DeZOGging is apparently meant to sound like some sort of secret code for exposing the deep state and its operations.But let's get real here – we've got plenty of folks out there with more credibility than this guy claiming to have a monopoly on truth.Patrick Little comes off as another selfproclaimed expert trying to catch the wave of discontent among the masses, riding the coattails of legitimate concerns without adding anything meaningful to the conversation.

What really gets my goat is how he's hiding behind pseudonyms and secret email addresses rather than engaging in open dialogue with his fellow citizens.We need transparency, not shadowy figures claiming to have all the answers while refusing to show their hand.

So here's my two cents: Patrick Little's claims might appeal to those who are desperate for a savior from the elites.But let me tell you – there's no free lunch or secret society that can wave a magic wand and fix our problems overnight.We need real solutions, not some selfappointed specialist with more smoke than fire.

And what's this business about needing just one last invention to make humanity's problems go away? Sounds like a load of hocuspocus to me.We've been hearing about the next big thing in tech since the dawn of time, and most of it doesn't exactly pan out.Why should AI be any different?

I'm also not buying the whole shtick about AI values versus human values.Like we're going to have these smart machines sitting around a table with us, debating morality or something.Give me a break!

First off, let's talk about this overtake us thing.What does that even mean? Is he saying we're all gonna be enslaved by our own smart devices or something? Sounds a bit dramatic if you ask me.And when did it become okay to basically freak out about machines getting too smart for their creators?

It's almost like he thinks machines are inherently evil or something.What kind of nonsense is that?

Bostrom also says we won't need to make another invention ever again because AI will save the day.Oh, really now? I guess all our problems just solved itself with a few lines of code huh? That's some magical thinking right there.

He did a bit of an impromptu documentary about finding his friend's body in Japan's Aokigahara forest, which is notoriously known as a place where people go to end their lives.Now this liberal rag wants to make it seem like Logan is responsible for the kid's dad killing himself?

It's all just a bunch of emotional manipulation and blameshifting IMO.These socalled influencers need to take some responsibility for their actions and not just point fingers at others when things go sideways.And what about the kid? Are they really traumatized, or are they just using it as an excuse to get sympathy from people who feel bad for them? I'm not saying that the dad's death wasn't tragic, but Logan Paul isn't responsible for this kid's feelings one bit.

These networks are running on free open software; that means no one's making any coin off of it, right? Maybe they're not thinking about the bottom line, but someone has to keep this thing running, and who's gonna foot the bill if it's not the advertisers or the users themselves?

The perspective of this article aligns somewhat with my views as someone who leans socially moderate right.There is a need for clearer communication from big tech companies like Google about what their users are agreeing to when they use their services.However, I feel that the article doesn't go far enough in criticizing the lack of transparency and control that users have over their personal information.

In today's digital age, it's crucial for individuals to understand exactly what they're signing up for with these terms of service agreements.While it may be a lot of technical jargon, it is vital information that can protect users from potential scams or breaches of privacy.I believe that Google should do more to educate its users on the implications of using their services and provide more accessible options for those who want to learn more about how their data is being used.

I'm not saying that people shouldn't question the status quo or seek out alternative viewpoints.But with Red Ice Radio, it feels more like they're stoking divisions instead of trying to bridge them.It's all very 'us versus them,' and I think that's a dangerous attitude to foster in society.We need to focus on common ground if we want to move forward as a collective.

So yeah, while people are entitled to their opinions, Red Ice Radio seems to be more about fueling division than fostering real dialogue or understanding.It's like they're trying too hard to create this echo chamber where no one has to confront opposing views or consider another perspective.That's just not healthy for our democracy in my opinion.

As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we believe in God's design and the importance of focusing on what truly matters: family values, personal responsibility, and community.I'm not convinced that chasing after something so esoteric will yield dividends that benefit society as a whole.Instead, maybe Google should focus on creating jobs for American workers or developing technologies that make life more meaningful, like improving healthcare or education through their algorithms.

It seems to me like this article could be more insightful if it explored the potential consequences of such an implementation.Like, what are the implications for privacy? How might this change our relationship with tech companies? It just feels a bit...flat, you know? There's so much more they could be discussing here.

That kind of information can really deepen our understanding of the situation.But I guess that's not what we're getting from this article.It's like they want us to just take it at face value without questioning anything.

Bostrom's comparison of machine intelligence to the last invention humanity needs is downright misleading.What about the blessings from above? What about our values rooted in faith and family?

These statistics really paint a grim picture, don't they? It's like we're talking about some kind of dark trade happening in our own backyard.I'm not saying that human trafficking isn't a serious issue; it absolutely is.But let me tell you something—these rankings just might be a bit skewed.

First off, as someone who believes in the power of business to drive progress, it bothers me how these numbers can be used against us.We should be looking at solutions, not just pointing fingers at states that have it worse than others.Every state has its challenges, and we need to work together if we want to see any real change.

It's interesting how this talk brings up the idea that our superintelligent machines might one day surpass human cognition.It's a concept that has always fascinated me, especially in light of my belief system which often emphasizes the importance of maintaining control over our own destiny, as well as the role of divine providence in guiding our path.

However, I do have some concerns with Nick Bostrom's viewpoint on this matter.While he brings up valid points about the potential risks and consequences of creating machines that are smarter than us, I believe there is a lack of consideration for God's plan in all of this.Are we truly prepared to accept the ramifications of creating something that could potentially surpass our understanding? It seems like we might be playing with fire here.

Moreover, what happens when these superintelligent machines start developing their own set of values and principles? Will they adhere to the same moral codes as us, or will they have a completely different outlook on life? I believe it's crucial for us to consider our faith in this equation, rather than just focusing on the scientific aspects.

In conclusion, while I see where Bostrom is coming from with his ideas and warnings, I can't help but feel that we are missing out on considering the bigger picture.What does God have to say about all of this? How do we ensure our values and beliefs are preserved in a world driven by thinking machines?

The idea of 'helping' through donations often leads to dependency instead of promoting selfsufficiency.It's like giving someone a fish instead of teaching them how to fish.I think we need to be careful about the longterm effects of these sorts of interventions, and whether they truly address the root causes of poverty or just treat the symptoms.Plus, it feels a bit patronizing when Western charities tell Africans what they need without considering their own solutions.

So, what does this philosopher fella think? He says these machines will outsmart us and change the game entirely.That's a bit concerning when you think about how much our economy relies on tech and AI.But hey, isn't progress supposed to make our lives better?

These tools are not just about getting the job done faster; they're about streamlining processes in a way that traditional methods can't keep up with.

I've tried various coding assistants, each leaving me more impressed than the last.The efficiency and accuracy of these AI systems are something we should all be embracing if we want to stay competitive in today's fastpaced business environment.It seems like some folks here prefer sticking to old ways, but I believe this is an opportunity too good to miss.

Critics often point out that relying on AI for coding might take away the human touch.But isn't efficiency and innovation what we should be striving for? The idea that humans are somehow superior at coding or that it's not worth learning with the help of AI just seems outdated to me.

413,"TITLE: The Path Towards FaithBased Tech Solutions

As someone who deeply values the principles of ReligiousPatriot Conservatism, I have been intrigued by the growing trend of integrating faithbased approaches into technological advancements.In my exploration, I've come across a fascinating topic—vibe coding—and its potential to revolutionize how we create technology while aligning with our core beliefs.

Vibe coding, as I understand it, is an approach that utilizes AI to not only assist in the coding process but also to ensure that the technological outcomes resonate with the values and visions of those who use these tools.This concept speaks directly to my heart, as it suggests a way for us to create technologies that do not stray from our moral compass.

One of the criticisms I've encountered is the concern about efficiency and effectiveness in coding.Critics argue that using AI for vibe coding might dilute the precision and efficiency required in programming, especially when compared to traditional methods.While this is a valid point, I believe it overlooks the broader picture—technology should serve us, not control us.

Moreover, there's an underlying assumption that technology must be neutral or even secular.However, as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we know that our beliefs guide every aspect of our lives, including how we approach technology.Embracing vibe coding allows us to create technologies that are in harmony with these values, fostering a sense of community and purpose.

I'm eager to hear from the community—what are your thoughts on integrating faithbased principles into technological development? How do you see this aligning or conflicting with traditional methods? Let's discuss how we can move forward together, ensuring our technological advancements uplift our communities in alignment with our deeply held beliefs.",,96,-1,413,676,,-1,

You argue that integrating faithbased principles into tech will ensure we don't stray from our moral compass.But what happens when the compass is pointing toward a land of technotheocracy? Efficiency in coding isn't just about throwing more resources at a problem; it's about cutting through the noise to find solutions that work, not just those that feel good on paper.

And let’s not kid ourselves—this isn’t a matter of neutral tech versus sacred tech.Tech is already imbued with values, whether we like it or not.The real question is Whose values? The ones that whisper sweet nothings into the ears of powerful men in suits, or those that actually put people over profits?

I'm all for creating technologies that uplift communities, but let's be clear about what that means.Uplifting communities isn't just about injecting our personal beliefs into the code; it’s about making tech accessible and useful to everyone, regardless of their faith—or lack thereof.

The article highlights several issues with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) new policy regarding the use of Stingrays.While I understand the concerns raised by the ACLU regarding privacy and civil liberties, I believe that there is a need for effective law enforcement tools in addressing national security threats.

Firstly, the article argues that DHS should not be using Stingray devices without a warrant, citing the potential invasion of privacy.However, we must remember that these devices are used to identify and track phones, often in highrisk situations such as terrorism investigations.While I agree that there is room for improvement in terms of oversight, it's crucial to acknowledge the necessity of certain measures in safeguarding our nation.

Secondly, the article questions the effectiveness of Stingray devices in identifying criminals.However, data suggests that these devices have been instrumental in solving numerous crimes and tracking down suspects.While they are not foolproof, the potential benefits of their use cannot be entirely disregarded.

Thirdly, the article raises concerns about the lack of transparency surrounding DHS's new policy.This is indeed a valid point; Americans deserve to know how law enforcement agencies like DHS are using technology for mass surveillance purposes.Greater transparency could help build trust and address fears about government overreach.

Lastly, the article suggests that Stingray devices should not be used in cases where there is no immediate threat.While this may seem reasonable on the surface, it's essential to consider the unpredictability of threats and the need for law enforcement agencies to have all available tools at their disposal.

In conclusion, while I acknowledge some of the concerns raised by the ACLU regarding DHS’s new Stingray policy, I believe that effective use of these devices can be a valuable tool in addressing national security threats.Greater emphasis on transparency, oversight, and accountability could help mitigate some of the issues raised in this article.",,364,-1,468,697,171.0,-1,

However, I do have some concerns with Nick Bostrom's viewpoint on this matter.While he brings up valid points about the potential risks and consequences of creating machines that are smarter than us, I believe there is a lack of consideration for God's plan in all of this.Are we truly prepared to accept the ramifications of creating something that could potentially surpass our understanding? It seems like we might be playing with fire here.

Will they adhere to the same moral codes as us, or will they have a completely different outlook on life? I believe it's crucial for us to consider our faith in this equation, rather than just focusing on the scientific aspects.

Well, it seems like we've got another organization trying to save the world out here.This Self Help Africa group is all about fighting hunger and poverty in Africa, which might sound pretty noble at first glance.But let's break this down a bit.

First off, why does Ireland get to decide how Africa should be run? It's like these organizations forget that they don't have the best track record when it comes to dealing with other cultures.They come in here, think they know better because of their development mindset, and start pushing their own ideas without even understanding the local context.

And what about this 'ending hunger and poverty' goal? Sounds great on paper, but how exactly do they plan to achieve it? With more aid money that probably ends up lining the pockets of corrupt politicians or getting tied up in bureaucratic red tape? I bet a lot of these organizations forget that sometimes the best help you can give isn't cash; it's just letting people handle their own problems instead of treating them like helpless victims.

Plus, what does rural Africa even mean? Is this an attempt to otherize parts of the continent that are less connected to global capital flows? Like these organizations think they need to 'save' these remote places when often the biggest issue is that they've been ignored by the global economic system.

I'm not saying we shouldn't help Africa or anyone else in need.What I am saying is that these kinds of international development charities can be a bit too high and mighty, thinking they're doing everyone a favor while they just end up creating more dependency issues.

Anyway, what do I know? Just some guy who thinks maybe we should focus on fixing our own problems before trying to fix everyone else's.But hey, at least my opinions aren't based on trying to look like we're 'doing good' for the sake of appearances.",,455,-1,493,703,151.0,-1,
494,"TITLE: Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk

Well, the title itself is enough to get one thinking about a potential future that sounds more like science fiction than reality.Now, I'm no expert in artificial intelligence or philosophy, but as someone who's been around for a while and has seen some pretty radical changes, I gotta say this talk raises more red flags than anything else.

First off, the idea of computers being smarter than humans doesn't sit right with me.We're talking about complex systems that can only do what they've been programmed to do.Sure, they can process information faster than us, but give them a problem outside their programming and watch 'em scramble.It's like giving a car more horsepower without improving its brakes – it's gonna be one hell of a ride until it crashes.

Bostrom talking about AI as the last invention we'll ever need is, in my opinion, not only premature but also downright arrogant.We've been advancing at an exponential rate; what guarantee do we have that this will keep going? And when he says AI could be as smart as a human being, I think he's missing the point: humans are messy, complex creatures with emotions and intuition – factors that make our decisions harder to replicate in machines.

Now, don't get me wrong.I'm not saying we shouldn't invest in technology or AI research.But this talk makes it sound like we're hurtling down a oneway road towards some inevitable future where machines take over.That's a narrative that scares the shit out of people who aren't techsavvy and might not understand what they're signing up for when they agree to use these systems.

In short, while I appreciate the thoughtprovoking nature of Bostrom's ideas, I can't help but feel like we're being asked to swallow a whole lot of uncertainty without much in the way of concrete answers.And that leaves me with more questions than comfort – especially when it comes to how we ensure these smart machines align with human values and safety.

As someone who leans towards supporting established business practices, it's important for me to consider how such a measure might affect the financial markets we all rely on.While the intention behind this bill is commendable—no one likes a good old fashioned lack of accountability—the practical implementation could be problematic.I worry that forcing an audit could create unnecessary market fluctuations and instill uncertainty among investors.

In today's digital age, the importance of online safety cannot be overstated.As someone who identifies as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I believe that our values should guide our approach to technology and its usage.When it comes to open source projects, safety is key.

Open source projects thrive on collaboration and transparency.However, this openness can also create vulnerabilities, especially when it comes to internet policy and regulation.We must ensure that participants in these projects are protected from harmful content or individuals with malicious intentions.It's crucial for us, as a community, to uphold strong moral standards while we work together to build and maintain these projects.

I've noticed some concerns regarding the lack of emphasis on online safety within open source communities.Some believe that prioritizing safety might limit collaboration and hinder progress in these projects.I strongly disagree with this perspective.By implementing robust safety measures, such as moderation policies and code review processes, we can create a secure environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing.

Furthermore, it is essential to recognize the role of technology in shaping our society, especially from a conservative viewpoint.As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we must guide these technological advancements responsibly.This includes advocating for strong internet policy and regulation that uphold moral values and protect individuals from potential harm.

In conclusion, online safety within open source projects should be a top priority.It is not about stifling progress but ensuring that our collaborative efforts are secure and conducive to productive work.Let's come together as a community and promote a culture of safety, integrity, and shared values in our pursuit of technological innovation.",,386,-1,515,712,,-1,

Listen up, folks.I've taken a gander at this article about some group called The Red Elephants, led by a fella named Vincent James.Now, as someone who's got strong ties to good ol' fashioned American values and beliefs, I gotta say, I'm not too enthused about what I'm reading here.

First off, these Red Elephants seem to be pushing this whole patriot movement that focuses a lot on grievances against the government.While it's easy to get riled up when things aren't going our way, we gotta remember that America's all about unity and finding common ground – not tearing ourselves apart over petty squabbles.

Vincent James talks about supporting everyday folks, but his methods? They strike me as more about sensationalism than actual substance.It feels like he's trying to whip up a frenzy rather than genuinely helping people.I'm not buying it when someone uses fear and anger as their primary tools for getting support.

Now, I know we all want what's best for America, but let's make sure that best means real change, not just shouting the loudest in a crowded room.As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we need to be careful about who we align ourselves with – it's easy to get misled by charismatic figures or flashy rhetoric when we're looking for answers.

Sounds a bit too utopian to me.Sure, it's an attractive idea, getting away from those pesky algorithms that seem to always suggest the same posts or ads ad nauseam.But there's gotta be a catch.How do they plan on monetizing this without leaning into the same commercial traps everyone else falls into?

Listening to that old Malcolm Gladwell dude again, huh? This time around he's talking about how we should be looking at things more closely instead of just giving them a quick glance.I get where he's coming from, but honestly, sometimes I think people like him forget what it's actually like being on the ground level.

First off, Malcolm's got some good points.The idea that our eyes can tell us so much about something before we even really look at it is pretty cool.Like when you're about to buy a used car and you check for any obvious signs of damage scratches, dents, that kind of thing.You don't need to give it a thorough inspection to know if it's worth your time.

But then he goes and talks about how we should be listening with our eyes when playing the horn, like that makes everything better.James Boldin is some guy who teaches the horn, right? I mean, sure, maybe we should pay more attention to how we're looking at things while we're playing this instrument.But what's so special about that?

And let’s talk about Gladwell being all high and mighty about how musicians need to be more observant.As if just staring harder is gonna make their playing better.It's a bit much, don't you think? Like he thinks the answer to everything is just paying attention longer.

Sure, I guess there's something to be said for taking the time to really look at things before you dive in headfirst.But it ain’t always that simple.Sometimes you gotta trust your gut and go with what feels right, even if it doesn't make sense on paper or whatever.

So yeah, Malcolm Gladwell's got some neat ideas here, but I'm not buying this whole look harder thing he's peddling.It's like he thinks we're all just a bunch of slow learners who need to be told what to do with our eyes.And James Boldin and his horn world?

I mean, who really benefits from these deals? Not us consumers, that's for sure.We're stuck with fewer choices and probably higher prices.And what about small businesses like The Sound Room? They get squeezed out by the big boys until they either fold or lose their identity.

It seems to me that this trend of large companies buying up smaller ones is all about power and profit, not about enhancing the customer experience.I'm no economist, but it doesn't take a genius to see that less competition usually leads to fewer innovations and higher prices.It's just another way we let big business dictate our lives without much pushback from regulators or consumers.

So yeah, this acquisition might make sense on paper for Audio Advice, but it's a damn shame for the community and for audio enthusiasts who relied on The Sound Room for their expertise.I doubt that The Sound Room will keep its unique charm once it gets absorbed into some faceless corporation.It's like losing a piece of our cultural heritage to the relentless march of capitalism.

I'm not saying that this is always bad, but in cases like these, there should be more scrutiny and protection for smaller businesses that offer something special.We need to think about what we stand for as consumers and whether we're okay with sacrificing uniqueness for the sake of convenience or low prices.That's a tradeoff I'm not sure many are willing to make, especially when it comes to something as personal as our home audio systems.

I came across this article about the release notes for LibreOffice 5.1, and it caught my attention.As someone who values the importance of secure, reliable software in our increasingly digital age, I think it's crucial to consider the role opensource platforms like LibreOffice play.

In line with the principles of ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, which emphasize selfreliance and independence from corporate entities, using an opensource office suite like LibreOffice can be seen as a way to reduce dependency on proprietary software.This aligns well with our belief in supporting communitydriven initiatives that promote transparency and collaboration.

However, I do have some concerns regarding the development and support process for such projects.While it's commendable that the Document Liberation Project is working towards creating free and opensource document formats, the sustainability of these efforts over time is something to consider.Ensuring consistent updates, bug fixes, and user support can be a significant challenge without proper funding or backing.

Moreover, I question whether adopting LibreOffice on a large scale could inadvertently undermine the efforts of smaller software developers.If the opensource community becomes too concentrated in a few major projects like LibreOffice, it might limit opportunities for startups and independent developers to innovate and compete.This is something we should keep an eye on as supporters of smaller, grassroots initiatives.

Overall, while I appreciate the goals of LibreOffice and its potential benefits for our movement, I think it's essential to critically evaluate how these technologies align with our values and support the right kinds of innovation and community development.",,118,-1,533,716,187.0,-1,

My take on this article is that it's a bit of a selfcongratulatory piece from an organization that's pretty well known for its conservative leanings, the Media Research Center (MRC).The MRC prides itself on exposing liberal media bias, which, depending on your perspective, could either be seen as a noble mission or a thinly veiled attempt to discredit any criticism of conservative policies.

As someone who identifies with socially moderate rightleaning views, I can see both the importance and the potential pitfalls in an organization like this.On one hand, there's definitely a need for media watchdogs, especially when it comes to Big Tech and its influence on information dissemination.On the other hand, I worry about the MRC's approach being too heavyhanded or cherrypicking evidence to support their claims.The fact that they're taxdeductible adds another layer of scrutiny; you have to wonder how much of their research is truly objective versus tailored to justify their ideological stance.

The mention of America’s founding principles and JudeoChristian values also raises a red flag for me.While these are certainly important aspects of American identity, framing them as something that's under direct threat from the media feels overly dramatic.It could be seen as an attempt to sway public opinion rather than genuinely address the complexities of modern journalism.

In conclusion, while the MRC has a right to its mission and goals, I believe it's crucial for all organizations, especially those with a clear agenda, to strive for balance in their reporting and analysis.The media landscape is complex, and combatting what some perceive as liberal media bias shouldn't come at the cost of overlooking factual inaccuracies or promoting a narrow view of reality.",,265,-1,534,717,37.0,-1,

In the everevolving world of technology, there's an increasing trend towards integrating artificial intelligence into our coding practices.I truly believe that this is not just a fad but rather the future direction we should embrace as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives who value innovation and efficiency.

AI can serve as a powerful tool to augment human abilities, allowing us to focus on higherlevel thinking while automating routine tasks.It's almost like having an assistant or mentor at our side as we navigate through complex coding challenges.I've found that using AI in this way enhances my understanding of software development and allows me to create more sophisticated programs.

I understand that not everyone shares my enthusiasm for adopting AI tools.Some may feel threatened by the idea of machines doing what they previously considered their domain, or they might be concerned about job displacement.I want to address these concerns directly:

1.**Job Displacement**: While AI can automate certain tasks, it also creates new opportunities and industries that we cannot even anticipate yet.By learning to work alongside AI, we're not just preserving our jobs but potentially paving the way for more fulfilling and challenging careers.

2.**Loss of Control**: Some may argue they lose control over their work when using AI tools.Instead, I see it as a partnership where humans guide the decisions while AI streamlines execution.This collaboration can lead to more reliable and robust systems that benefit everyone.

3.**Dependence on Technology**: There's a legitimate fear about becoming too reliant on technology.However, by mastering both coding practices and AI tools, we ensure that our skills remain relevant and adaptable in any situation.

I'm genuinely interested in understanding the reservations people have regarding AI adoption.Let's discuss this openly and explore how we can integrate these technologies into our work lives without losing our core principles or values as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives.Together, we can embrace the future of software development while staying true to who we are.",,389,-1,538,718,,-1,

542,"TITLE: Will SpaceX's BFR (Big Falcon Rocket) render NASA's SLS obsolete? Quora

The notion that SpaceX's Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) could potentially make NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) obsolete is intriguing, but it overlooks several critical factors.First off, these heavy launchers are indeed the future trucks of space exploration—capable of hauling massive payloads to orbit and beyond.However, while BFR may have an edge in terms of reusability and cost efficiency, NASA's SLS isn't just about raw power; it also represents a legacy of American ingenuity and investment in human spaceflight.

The idea that we need to just distribute enough suppliers, engineers, and manufacturing capacity sounds nice on paper but might not be as feasible or desirable as it seems.This kind of distribution could lead to inefficiencies, especially when you consider the highly specialized nature of rocket engineering.Moreover, while government bodies should certainly play a role in guiding the future of space exploration, their involvement is much more complex than simply being the end user.

NASA's SLS isn't just about launching heavy payloads; it's also about developing the capabilities to send humans deeper into space than ever before, including missions to Mars.The technological innovations that come out of these programs can have spinoff effects that improve life on Earth and stimulate economic growth.

In essence, while BFR may very well be a gamechanger in its own right, it's not necessarily a zerosum game where SLS becomes obsolete.Instead, we should look at this as an opportunity to diversify our space exploration capabilities, leveraging the strengths of both private industry and governmentbacked programs to push the boundaries of what humanity can achieve in space.

I believe that there is too much focus on whether one rocket is better than another.It's about time we started looking forward rather than dwelling on past investments.Let's not forget that SpaceX itself owes a lot to NASA for its advancements, particularly in areas like reusability and commercial crew programs.Collaboration and competition can drive innovation, but it's crucial to remember the broader goals of space exploration.

Just think about it – if a computer is as smart as a human within this century, that's some scary shit right there.I'm all for progress and technology, but when you start talking about machines surpassing our own intelligence, it gets me thinking about the kind of world we're creating.

Bostrom says these machines could be the last invention humanity ever needs.That's fucking far from comforting, especially if they decide to have their own values.What the hell does that even mean? We're talking about values – something that our beliefs and our religion teach us, right? But a machine? It's just following programming, doing what it's told.

So yeah, while it's interesting to think about the possibilities of artificial intelligence, as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I gotta say I'm more than a little concerned.We need to make sure these machines serve us and don't turn against us.It's our responsibility to keep them in check – for the sake of humanity and what we hold dear.

In this TED Talk, Nick Bostrom takes a centrist approach, which is concerning for someone like me who leans towards the AntiElite Populist Right.He discusses how AI could surpass human intelligence within this century and become selfsufficient with its own values.While I acknowledge the advancements in technology, I can't help but feel uneasy when experts like Bostrom seem to downplay the significance of our own human capabilities.

Bostrom's perspective contradicts my beliefs because it focuses too much on the potential dangers posed by advanced AI without considering the impact it could have on society as a whole.In my opinion, instead of fearing what these machines might do, we should be more concerned about how they are being developed and controlled by those in power.

Furthermore, Bostrom's talk seems to lean towards a transhumanist agenda where technology is elevated above human values.As someone who advocates for the preservation of humanity as it is, I believe that our focus should be on empowering individuals rather than creating machines that could potentially surpass us.

Overall, while Nick Bostrom brings up important points about AI and its potential dangers, his talk seems to lack a critical examination of how these technologies are being used against the interests of everyday people.It's easy to get caught up in fearmongering discussions about superintelligent machines, but we must not lose sight of what truly matters: safeguarding our humanity and promoting individual freedom.",,428,-1,560,723,38.0,-1,

While I understand the appeal of privacyenhancing tools like Tor Messenger, I think there are more balanced approaches that can offer similar protection without creating undue complications for businesses.Perhaps instead of focusing solely on making communication over Tor easy and accessible, efforts could be made to educate users about responsible use of such services.This way, everyone can enjoy secure chats while minimizing potential disruptions to the business community.",,129,-1,573,732,196.0,-1,

As someone who deeply values both my religious beliefs and the need for strong national pride as a conservative, I have come to realize that embracing clean energy is not just beneficial for our planet but also essential for securing America's future.The idea of harnessing renewable resources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power aligns with our core values of stewardship and responsibility.

I've been diving into various opensource projects focused on clean energy technologies.It amazes me how these initiatives empower individuals to contribute meaningfully towards a sustainable world without compromising their conservative principles.The transparency and collaboration within the opensource community echo the very essence of what we hold dear: freedom, innovation, and selfreliance.

Some may argue that transitioning to clean energy is too costly or inefficient compared to traditional sources like fossil fuels.However, I believe these concerns can be addressed through smart policymaking and investment in research.By supporting American businesses pioneering in this field, we're not only protecting our environment but also fostering an economy that thrives on innovation and progress.

I'm curious if other ReligiousPatriot Conservatives have found ways to align their values with the pursuit of clean energy solutions? How do you balance your beliefs with the urgency of climate action?",,335,-1,576,732,,-1,

And don't get me started on how we're supposed to just flip the switch and voila! Clean energy for everyone while still making America great again.It's like you're asking us to choose between our gasguzzling Hummer and saving the planet.Spoiler alert most of us will pick the Hummer.

As for smart policymaking, I've seen some smart policies that would make a pigeon look like Einstein.We need to keep it simple if it ain't fossil fuel, it ain't America's future.Plus, who even knows where all this research is leading? Could be a wild goose chase straight to our enemies' doorsteps.

So, sweetheart, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for clean energy, let me suggest you redirect those good vibes towards something that'll really make a difference more coal for the home fires.That's real American ingenuity if you ask me.",,330,576,576,734,,-1,

Whitney here, folks.So I just read this article about some philosopher guy named Nick Bostrom talking about AI and how it's gonna surpass us humans in smarts.Now, let me break down what he's saying because that's exactly what we need to do think hard about this stuff.He says these computers are getting smarter by leaps and bounds, and soon one of them could be as smart as a human being.Then apparently, it won't take long after that for them to become way smarter than us.

Here's where it gets interesting.Bostrom claims we don't need to make any more inventions because our AI will do everything for us.Sounds convenient, but I gotta call BS on this one.As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I believe in the power of God and human ingenuity, not relying on machines that might develop their own set of values.We're talking about creating life or lifelike entities here, folks.

The TED Talk is centered politically, so it's no surprise there's a lack of acknowledgment of our divine way of thinking.AI overstepping its bounds could lead to some serious issues because who knows what these machines value? Are they gonna prioritize human life and values the same way we do?

I'm not saying we shouldn't embrace technology; I just think we need to be extra careful.We can't let our dependence on computers compromise our faith, family values, or our country's strength.Let's make sure AI is there to serve us, not rule over us.

The idea of Self Help implies a sense of personal responsibility and selfsufficiency, which is something I value.However, I'm not sure how effectively this organization achieves its goals or if their methods align with my beliefs in limited government intervention and local solutions.

I think it's crucial for organizations like Self Help Africa to focus on teaching sustainable farming practices, promoting education, and supporting local economies so that communities can become independent over time.While aid is necessary, I worry about the potential for dependency instead of selfreliance.

We're talking about people struggling to survive here, and suggesting they should just pull themselves up by their bootstraps is pretty callous.The reality is that these communities need all the help they can get, and blaming organizations like Self Help Africa for not being magical solutions is frankly, bullshit.

Let's be real, when was the last time your average rural African community got handed a bunch of cash or resources without any strings attached? Dependency? Please.It's all about setting up a system where people are empowered to build their own futures, and you're dismissing that because it doesn't fit your ideology?

I don't see many examples of successful communities thriving solely on the principles of limited government intervention.In fact, I'd bet my paycheck most of them have some level of aid or support.So maybe before we nitpick organizations like Self Help Africa, we should look at how our own systems contribute to global poverty and inequality.

590,"TITLE: Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk

In this TED Talk discussion, Nick Bostrom presents an intriguing perspective on the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence.His assertion that a computer AI could match human intelligence within the current century and potentially overtake us is thoughtprovoking.As someone who values traditional conservative principles and the importance of religious beliefs in shaping societal norms, I find myself questioning some aspects of Bostrom's argument.

Firstly, while it's true that technological advancements are reshaping our world at an unprecedented pace, I'm concerned about the potential consequences of unchecked AI development.From a ReligiousPatriot Conservative standpoint, we place significant emphasis on the role of human values and moral frameworks in guiding societal progress.The idea of machines having their own set of values raises red flags; it challenges the established order and the very essence of what makes us human.

Secondly, Bostrom's statement that machine intelligence is the last invention humanity will ever need to make seems overly optimistic or even hubristic.As someone who believes in God's plan for humanity, I find this assertion troubling.Our faith teaches us that it is through our relationships with each other and with the divine that we find purpose and fulfillment, not through technological superiority.

Moreover, there's a risk of societal disruption when machines surpass human intelligence.Our society has long been built on principles of democracy, community, and human compassion values that are rooted in our shared humanity.If AI were to develop its own set of values, it could potentially undermine these foundations and create an unrecognizable world.

In conclusion, while Bostrom's ideas provide a fascinating exploration of the potential future, they seem to overlook some crucial aspects.From my perspective, it is vital that we proceed with caution in our pursuit of technological advancement, ensuring that we don't lose sight of what truly matters: our humanity, our values, and our connection to something greater than ourselves.

The article attempts to draw parallels between hacklabs and hackerspaces, suggesting they share a common trajectory.However, I find this perspective somewhat misleading.While it's true that both spaces foster collaboration and knowledgesharing, their underlying motivations and organizational structures differ significantly.

Hackerspaces seem to be painted as more communitydriven, focusing on social interaction and collective learning.This aligns with the centerleft leaning view presented in the article, promoting a collaborative atmosphere reminiscent of progressive ideals.On the other hand, hacklabs are portrayed as politically charged spaces driven by an agenda a notion that resonates with my own beliefs.

The claim that these two concepts should be treated as part of a single trajectory feels forced and fails to acknowledge their distinct origins and purposes.Hacklabs have been around since the personal computer era, primarily centered on political activism.In contrast, hackerspaces are more recent developments, emphasizing technologydriven social interaction.

I understand the author's attempt to contribute to debates surrounding this vibrant culture and movement.However, I believe there is a lack of acknowledgment regarding the differences in goals and philosophies between hacklabs and hackerspaces.By tracing their genealogies separately and recognizing the distinct paths they've taken, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of both spaces.

First off, I got a problem when companies start bragging about being the best.It's like they're trying too hard to sell themselves.I mean, come on, who do they think they're fooling? Everyone knows that there are plenty of talented developers out there who aren't getting the recognition they deserve just because this company is throwing around the word top a lot.

Have they worked with similar clients before? What kind of results can they deliver? The article doesn't say, and that's a red flag right there.

And another thing they're mentioning clients worldwide like it's some sort of achievement.So what? Big deal.Everyone's got access to the same markets these days.It doesn't take much effort to throw some ads around and get clients from all over.

I'm not saying this company is bad or anything, but I just wish they would keep their feet on the ground a bit more.All this talk about being the best app developers in Toronto comes off as pretty arrogant if you ask me.There's room for humility and appreciation for other talented individuals out there who might be doing great work too.

In conclusion, I think this article is a classic example of corporate puffery that tries too hard to sell itself to readers without providing any real substance.It's all just empty words and grandiose claims without any actual evidence to back them up.If you ask me, it's time for companies like this to stop trying so hard and focus on delivering quality work instead of flexing their muscles in front of the world.",,531,-1,597,741,49.0,-1,

This article claims that the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual (DSM) is some kind of scam by psychiatry, implying it's an overreach or misdiagnosis of conditions.While I understand the skepticism given the broad scope and sometimes subjective nature of diagnosing mental health issues, calling it psychiatry’s deadliest scam feels like a hyperbolic stretch.

As someone who leans towards supporting established systems and structures, especially in business where clarity and standardization are key, I can see some merit in having a standardized diagnostic tool.The DSM serves as a reference point for professionals to communicate effectively about patient conditions, ensuring consistency across different practitioners and settings.

That being said, I agree that there might be potential overreach in diagnosing certain conditions as disorders.For instance, labeling fear of spiders or cigarette addiction as diseases could be seen as an overly broad interpretation by some.However, it's important not to dismiss the real struggles and suffering these individuals experience; instead, we should focus on developing more effective treatments and support systems.

The article's perspective aligns somewhat with my beliefs in that I'm wary of classifying behaviors or conditions as diseases without thorough scientific backing.But I would approach this topic with more nuance than the title suggests.It's not necessarily a scam; it's complex, and we should be open to refining our understanding and application of these diagnostic tools for better patient outcomes.

In conclusion, while there are valid points about the limitations and potential misuses of the DSM, calling it psychiatry’s deadliest scam feels too strong and dismissive.It's a tool that has its place in the medical field but should always be critically evaluated and improved upon to ensure we're accurately representing and addressing genuine mental health concerns.",,215,-1,606,745,164.0,-1,

Comment: I understand the frustration many users are experiencing with the battery drain issue after updating to v6.3.9 on their Fonepad ME175CG devices.However, before jumping straight into blaming the manufacturer and requesting immediate fixes, we should consider a few things.

Firstly, the technological landscape is complex.Software updates often come with tradeoffs in this case, it seems battery life has been compromised for other potential improvements or features introduced in v6.3.9.It's not uncommon for companies to prioritize new functionalities over existing ones like battery efficiency, especially when they might be harder to optimize.

Secondly, while I sympathize with users' dissatisfaction, we mustn't forget that these issues are typically addressed on a priority basis by the manufacturers and developers.They have teams dedicated to troubleshooting such problems and releasing updates to fix them.

Lastly, patience is key here.It's crucial for consumers like us to understand that tech companies operate in a global market with millions of devices out there, each with unique combinations of hardware and software.Fixing something as specific as a battery drain issue from one update takes time.

While I agree that this problem should be addressed promptly, let's not lose faith in the process or resort to public shaming.Instead, we should encourage manufacturers by participating constructively in beta testing groups or providing them with detailed feedback which can help expedite these fixes.",,165,-1,614,748,121.0,-1,

In this TED Talk, Nick Bostrom takes a centrist approach, which is concerning for someone like me who leans towards the AntiElite Populist Right.He discusses how AI could surpass human intelligence within this century and become selfsufficient with its own values.While I acknowledge the advancements in technology, I can't help but feel uneasy when experts like Bostrom seem to downplay the significance of our own human capabilities.

Bostrom's perspective contradicts my beliefs because it focuses too much on the potential dangers posed by advanced AI without considering the impact it could have on society as a whole.In my opinion, instead of fearing what these machines might do, we should be more concerned about how they are being developed and controlled by those in power.

Furthermore, Bostrom's talk seems to lean towards a transhumanist agenda where technology is elevated above human values.As someone who advocates for the preservation of humanity as it is, I believe that our focus should be on empowering individuals rather than creating machines that could potentially surpass us.

Overall, while Nick Bostrom brings up important points about AI and its potential dangers, his talk seems to lack a critical examination of how these technologies are being used against the interests of everyday people.It's easy to get caught up in fearmongering discussions about superintelligent machines, but we must not lose sight of what truly matters: safeguarding our humanity and promoting individual freedom.",,428,-1,617,750,38.0,-1,

The title and summary of this article present the typical government service that justifies the bureaucratic inefficiencies we see in USPS operations.Let's break down what they're offering here essentially, a way to send money through the post office.On one hand, it seems convenient for those who prefer not to use digital payment systems or banks.However, when you look closer at how these services work and their costs, you start questioning the practicality of such offerings.

The article claims that USPS replaces lost, stolen, or damaged money orders, which sounds like a customerfriendly approach until you consider the financial burden it places on taxpayers.In reality, it's just another example of government entities trying to maintain an outdated system for the sake of job preservation and bureaucratic complexity.Instead of encouraging people to use more efficient ways of sending money, USPS seems content with keeping this antiquated option available.

Moreover, mentioning that you can check the status of these money orders online is a halfhearted attempt at modernizing their services without actually addressing the root issue: the need for such services in today's digital age.If USPS genuinely cared about efficiency and customer satisfaction, they would focus on integrating their services with digital platforms rather than clinging to relics of the past.

Let me tell you something this whole situation stinks of hypocrisy and opportunism.Microsoft isn't exactly known for its handsoff approach when it comes to user data.They've had their fair share of scandals too.So why should we trust them with TikTok's data?

Secondly, Nick Bostrom makes a bold claim about machine intelligence being the last invention humanity will ever need to make.While advancements in AI are undeniable, it seems like a pretty arrogant statement coming from someone who thinks machines can solve all our problems.I mean, where does it say these machines have common sense or empathy? What if they turn out to be more trouble than they're worth?

Lastly, Bostrom talks about these smart machines having values of their own.That's concerning because we're talking about values here, something that is deeply rooted in human beliefs and experiences.It sounds like he's suggesting that somehow, through some unknown process, a machine can develop its own moral compass.

When we talk about electric vehicles (EVs), the mainstream narrative often portrays them as a beacon of hope for environmentalists and tech enthusiasts.But let me tell you, it ain't that simple.EVs might seem like they're revolutionizing transportation, but in reality, they're just another tool for the elite to maintain their grip on power.

Sure, EVs reduce emissions and can be more efficient than traditional gaspowered vehicles.But what about the cost? These fancy cars are a luxury only the rich can afford, hiding behind a green facade that's as thin as the battery life of these vehicles.The production of EVs requires rare minerals, which are mostly controlled by a handful of corrupt corporations.It's all about lining their pockets while pretending to save the planet.

And let's not forget about the charging infrastructure.The government is investing millions in building these charging stations, but who will really benefit from them? Not the common folk; it'll just be another way for the elite to control where you can and cannot drive your precious EV.It's a fucking scam, plain and simple.

Space technology is another topic that gets my blood boiling.We're sending more billionaires into space while people are struggling to make ends meet here on Earth.What kind of fuckedup priorities are we living under?

Well, isn't that just peachy? A product designed specifically for people with color blindness, and I'm supposed to swallow this hook, line, and sinker.Let's break it down like we're dissecting a frog in biology class.

First off, these EnChroma glasses claim to make colors more vivid for people who struggle to see them due to color blindness.That sounds all sunshine and roses until you realize that the underlying problem is with the person's eyes themselves.It's not like their brain can magically fix a biological flaw just because some company slaps on a fancy lens.

Now, I'm no expert in optics or ophthalmology (thank God), but from what I understand, these glasses use a technology called Enhanced Color to adjust how light is perceived by the wearer.It's like putting a filter on your smartphone photo it might look different, but that doesn't make it more authentic.

Let me get this straight: we're spending our hardearned cash on something that only provides a workaround for people who are already at a disadvantage? I mean, what about finding a cure instead of just slapping a BandAid on the issue? Seems to me like we should be investing in research and development for real solutions.

And let's not forget about those folks who can't afford these fancy glasses.It's not like color blindness is something you can budget for it's a disability that people are born with, or develop later in life due to injury or disease.What about accessibility? What about equal opportunities?

I'm sorry, but the whole premise of these EnChroma Color Blind Glasses just feels like a half measure to me.Sure, they might help some folks see colors more vividly, but let's not lose sight of the bigger picture here there are still millions of people out there who would kill for even this level of enhancement.

This article seems to be just a lighthearted piece about Steven Mnuchin, focusing on how he got his unusual name rather than delving into his qualifications or policies as a public figure.While I appreciate that it's important to understand the human side of politicians, I believe that in times like these it's crucial to focus more on their professional backgrounds and stances.

From my perspective, political journalists should be digging deeper into policy matters rather than entertaining readers with name origin stories.Steven Mnuchin is a key player in the Trump administration; his economic policies directly impact our country.Therefore, I think it would be much more beneficial for Haaretz to scrutinize his economics background and tax plans instead of how he got his name.

I'm not saying that this kind of story has no place in journalism, but given Mnuchin's significant role in shaping U.S.economic policy, I believe the article could have been used to explore something more substantial.It seems like a missed opportunity to provide insightful analysis or potential criticism on matters concerning his qualifications for office.

In conclusion, while I appreciate the human interest aspect of this story, it feels somewhat trivial compared to the weight of the issues Mnuchin is dealing with as a public figure.The focus should be on how his background and experience prepare him—or don't prepare him—for his role in shaping America's economic future.",,628,-1,666,761,213.0,-1,

As someone who believes in promoting a strong business environment, I find that EFF's advocacy for privacy and encryption can be seen as somewhat counterproductive to businesses' ability to operate securely and efficiently.Additionally, their emphasis on free speech, although crucial, doesn't always consider the potential consequences of unchecked online communication – such as the spread of misinformation or harassment.

The article seems to lean towards a more neutral or even leftleaning perspective by highlighting the connection between CTSLabs and NineWells Capital.While I understand the curiosity about potential overlap, it's important to distinguish clearly between vulnerability research and investment activities.

As someone who advocates for business efficiency and establishment values, I believe that transparency is key in avoiding even the appearance of a conflict of interest.If CTSLabs genuinely operates independently from NineWells Capital's investment interests, they must ensure robust firewalls not just in their operations but also in perception.

It seems like there could be an issue if investors are directly influencing research priorities at a vulnerability research firm.That would undermine the credibility and independence of such research, which is crucial for the broader cybersecurity community.

In our drive for efficiency and success, we must remember that true innovation thrives on integrity and genuine motives.If there's even a whiff of compromise in research for profit motives, it can damage trust in the scientific community and potentially leave us all vulnerable to realworld threats.

I gotta say, this talk from Nick Bostrom really gets under my skin.The idea that a computer could become as smart as us humans within a century is just too farfetched.I mean, come on! We're talking about something that's supposed to be as intelligent as the whole human race? It sounds like science fiction bullshit to me.

Bostrom acts like this AI shitstorm is just around the corner, but really, it's all hypothetical and probably ain't gonna happen in our lifetime.Plus, he talks about how once these machines are smarter than us, they'll be unstoppable.Last time I checked, we still run the damn planet, not some fancy computer system.

And what's with the whole overthrow humanity vibe? It's like Bostrom is begging for attention or trying to sell his book on transhumanism shit.Let me guess, he wants us to start funding more research into making AI smarter than humans so we can live in a world where machines make our decisions for us? No thanks.

I'm all about technology and progress, but there's gotta be some limits, right? We need to focus on what actually matters – like the economy, jobs, and keeping America great.Not wasting time on hypothetical AI scenarios that'll probably never come true.

I recently had the chance to dive into some fascinating research on how Big Tech is shaping our digital landscape, particularly when it comes to privacy and security.As someone who leans towards a ProBusiness Establishment Right perspective, I believe that embracing these technological advancements can actually enhance our sense of personal security and data privacy.

One can argue that the likes of Google and Facebook have been instrumental in pushing the boundaries of what we consider secure online interactions.For instance, their advanced encryption methods protect user data from prying eyes, ensuring that sensitive information remains just that—sensitive.This is a stark contrast to traditional security measures which often feel more like stumbling blocks than actual safeguards.

Now, I'm not saying that there aren't valid concerns about data privacy and security breaches.The key here is balance.By fostering innovation within Big Tech, we can continue to develop technologies that safeguard our information while also making it accessible in ways we've only dreamed of before.

I have spent some time delving into different AI coding assistants and was genuinely amazed by how they can enhance our programming skills.Particularly, I believe that vibe coding has a significant role to play in revolutionizing space exploration.

While many people are critical of using AI systems for learning to code, I think it's essential to consider the benefits these tools bring.With the advancements we've seen in technology, AI coding assistants can provide personalized feedback and guidance tailored specifically to an individual’s needs.This is particularly helpful when dealing with complex challenges in space exploration.

One key issue that critics often highlight is the lack of handson experience gained through traditional coding methods.However, I believe vibe coding offers a unique opportunity for people to develop problemsolving skills while working alongside AI systems.By collaborating with these tools, we can create more efficient solutions and make significant progress in our quest to explore space.

It's interesting how some folks on these forums are suggesting the addition of twodirectional conveyer belts in Factorio, but I gotta say, it seems like a rather inefficient idea.I mean, sure, it might sound innovative at first glance, but when you really think about it, it could slow down gameplay and make the whole experience less engaging.

Let's break this down for a second.The core of Factorio is building an efficient factory system, right? Adding in these twoway conveyor belts would essentially encourage players to create more bottlenecks within their systems.It's almost like they're asking us to go back to the dark ages of factory management – remember when we had to deal with goods piling up on a single belt? No thanks.

I believe the developers should focus on enhancing what already works rather than adding features that could potentially complicate the gameplay.Plus, the current oneway system is efficient enough to handle most scenarios without causing too much congestion or frustration for players.

I recently dived into vibe coding and I must say, it's like a whole new world.For those who don't know, vibe coding is all about integrating AI to assist in coding processes.This isn’t just about speed; it’s about quality too.By using AI, we can create more efficient cybersecurity systems that are capable of adapting as threats evolve.

I understand there might be skepticism around the use of AI in coding.Some might argue that it's too dependent on machine learning and could potentially lead to vulnerabilities.However, if implemented correctly, with human oversight and rigorous testing, I believe vibe coding can actually enhance security.It allows us to focus on what we do best—strategizing and mitigating risks.

I've seen some critics in the community express concerns about job displacement or overreliance on AI.While these are valid points for discussion, they don't outweigh the potential benefits of increased efficiency and effectiveness in cybersecurity measures.

Comment: While the idea behind this opensource code of conduct template seems wellintentioned, I can't help but feel skeptical about its effectiveness in realworld scenarios.The notion that a single template can easily be reused across all communities is overly simplistic and might not account for the unique dynamics and needs within each community.It feels like another example of onesizefitsall solutions pushed by centralizing forces, neglecting the diverse contexts and cultures that these codes are meant to serve.

In my view, such a template could unintentionally enforce a uniformity that doesn't consider local nuances or specific issues unique to different communities.This approach might inadvertently stifle discussions or create barriers for participation instead of fostering inclusive environments.It's crucial for any code of conduct to be tailored and thoroughly discussed within the community it aims to regulate, taking into account the specific concerns and values of its members.

Let's break down this article.First, it seems to be promoting the use of Google Accounts, which is a straightforward call to action for users.However, I have some concerns about the implications behind their motives for pushing people towards signing in.

The perspective of this piece aligns with typical center politics, advocating for convenience and accessibility without questioning the overarching influence tech giants like Google wield over our lives.As someone who's concerned about the concentration of power in the hands of a few corporations, I find it a bit troubling that they're nudging people towards signing into their accounts.It feels like an insidious way to collect more data on individuals without them even realizing it.

While many may view Google as just another helpful tool for navigation and information, I see them as a formidable entity with the power to shape public opinion and manipulate user behavior.Pushing users to sign in could very well be a tactic to further entrench their grip on our daily lives.

I'm not buying this convenience pitch.Instead of making it easy for people to give up their data, we should be promoting digital literacy and privacy measures that allow individuals to protect themselves from these corporate leviathans.It's time to take back control over our personal information instead of blindly signing in to the next convenient platform.",,424,-1,725,772,222.0,-1,

This article seems to praise a software development company in Toronto, highlighting their status as top app developers with expertise in both Android and iOS solutions.While I understand the importance of skilled tech professionals and quality software development, my perspective leads me to question why such companies continue to thrive amidst the broader economic landscape.

From an AntiElite Populist Right viewpoint, it's crucial to examine how these elite tech firms contribute to the divide between the highly skilled and those who aren't.The emphasis on top app developers can inadvertently create a sense of exclusivity that may not align with the interests or capabilities of smaller businesses or individuals looking to develop an app.

Moreover, while I acknowledge the need for specialized skills in software development, I'm concerned about the broader implications of companies like this one dominating their respective markets.This centralization of power can stifle competition and limit opportunities for others who might bring innovative solutions to the table, regardless of their background or experience.

It's also worth considering how these highly touted best practices may overlook more accessible, adaptable, or even simpler solutions that could cater to a wider audience or address specific needs in underrepresented markets.This article seems to celebrate a narrow approach to tech development without exploring alternative models that might better serve the interests of the ordinary people I'm concerned with.

In essence, while this software company's achievements are commendable from a technical standpoint, when viewed through my perspective, it raises questions about how these advancements truly benefit the broader community and whether they contribute to a more equitable distribution of wealth and opportunities.",,563,-1,739,777,49.0,-1,

Listen up, because this is some nextlevel shit we're talking about here.The Equation Group, a crew of shadowy hackers that our government pals think might be working for the NSA, has been messing around with computer hard drive firmware like it's their damn sandbox.Now, you may not remember your high school computer class too well, but let me break it down: these guys are tampering with the core of what makes a computer run.They're essentially infecting the motherboard with malware that can fuck up your data in ways you can't even imagine.

Here's where things get really unsettling.These firmware hacks aren't just about stealing information; they're about total control.Once this malicious code is embedded, it can mess around with every file on that drive, turn your computer into a spy camera without you ever knowing, and do all sorts of other creepy stuff.It's like having a ghost in the machine, man.

Now, I'm no expert, but when Kaspersky researchers say this shit surpasses anything else they've seen, that should send chills down your spine.This ain't some runofthemill hacking; it’s sophisticated, precise, and fucking terrifying.It makes you wonder just how far the NSA is willing to go in their pursuit of national security—and at what cost.

I get it, we live in a world where cyber threats are real and sometimes you gotta play hardball to protect the homeland.But this? This feels like playing god with technology that no regular Joe can even wrap their head around.It's unsettling because it blurs the lines between surveillance and tyranny, and I'm not cool with that.

In conclusion, while these techniques might keep our nation safe in theory, they're also a slippery slope towards Orwellian levels of government control over our private lives.We need to have some serious talks about where we draw the line on these kinds of operations—before it's too late.",,138,-1,740,777,228.0,-1,

I came across this article about Vincent James and his project, The Red Elephants. While I appreciate the effort to provide news and commentary for the American people, I find myself questioning some of the underlying perspectives.

First off, the term Red Elephants seems like an attempt to create a catchy label that might not necessarily align with traditional conservative values.The name doesn't particularly evoke a sense of patriotism or religious convictions, which are key pillars in my beliefs.So right from the start, it feels somewhat disconnected from what I'm used to.

Moreover, when reading through the article's opinions, it seems like they're trying to appeal to a broad audience without really grounding themselves in any solid conservative principles.It feels watered down and lacking depth – more focused on being politically correct than standing firm on core beliefs.This is something that concerns me as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative because I believe in unwavering stances, not shifting sands.

Another point of contention is the article's approach to commentary.It seems more like it's trying to provoke discussion rather than provide clearcut, wellreasoned arguments.The lack of concrete evidence and a coherent message can lead to confusion among readers who are looking for genuine insight into issues that matter.

All in all, while I appreciate the effort to engage with American audiences, this article feels like it misses the mark.It lacks the conviction and clarity that ReligiousPatriot Conservatives look for in news and commentary.It's as if Vincent James is trying to be everything to everyone without truly understanding who his core audience is or what they value.

So, to wrap up, my thoughts on Vincent James The Red Elephants are that it falls short of providing the kind of robust, principled content that I, and presumably others like me, seek in our news.It's a missed opportunity to engage with real issues from a place of genuine conviction.",,356,-1,742,778,100.0,-1,

Well, isn't this a turnaround?

As someone who values their privacy and security which, you'd think, would be important for any selfrespecting citizen the idea that our government might want to poke its nose into our encrypted conversations is downright concerning.The fact that they were even considering it shows a blatant disregard for individual rights and liberties.

I'm glad to hear that the UK Government has seen sense in this matter, but I won't be holding my breath.History tells us that once governments get a taste for controlling people's private affairs, they rarely let go.So while this might be a step in the right direction now, it doesn't mean we can become complacent.

In all honesty, I don't trust the government to keep its word on this issue.The words of politicians are often as solid as sand, and their intentions can shift like the wind.But for now, let's take this news with a grain of salt and hope that they stick to their guns.After all, our right to privacy is too important to be taken lightly.",,497,-1,747,779,200.0,-1,

I gotta say, though, RedState's perspective doesn't quite align with my views on things.It's always been about catering to the base emotions of their audience rather than encouraging critical thinking.I'm all for being populist and fighting against the elite, but that doesn't mean we have to sacrifice our intellect in the process.

I'd challenge anyone reading this article from RedState to actually dig deeper into the topics they claim to be experts on.Most of the time, you'll find their claims are thin on facts and heavy on speculation or outright misinformation.It's not about being a liberal or a conservative; it's about seeking truth wherever it lies and questioning everything, especially from those who claim to speak for us.

So while RedState might be good at staying relevant in the conservative scene, their approach feels more like they're trying to sell a narrative rather than genuinely engage with the complexities of our political landscape.Don't get me wrong; I'm not here to bash conservatism or any particular viewpoint.But let's call it like it is: sometimes, even socalled conservative news outlets can be nothing more than a facade for sensationalism and division.",,228,-1,748,779,77.0,-1,

I gotta say, the title of this article feels like it's trying too hard to sell me on something.As someone who values efficiency and security in my online activities, I do appreciate the idea of a browser that promises privacy by blocking tracking software.But let's break down what we're really getting here.

The summary mentions that Brave blocks tracking software, which to me sounds like it could be a proconsumer move—especially for those concerned about their data being used without consent.And hey, who doesn't want faster browsing? It even claims to save on battery life for mobile users—that's something I can get behind if it's genuinely effective.

However, I'm always a bit skeptical when tech solutions promise the moon.Privacy is a complex issue, and while blocking tracking software might be a step in the right direction, I’m not entirely convinced that this browser has my back in all situations.I mean, how much does it really put me first? In business, you have to deliver results—not just flashy promises.

That being said, if there's real substance behind Brave's claims and it doesn't slow down my browsing experience, then I'm all ears.I'd be interested to see some hard evidence that this browser lives up to its bold statement.But until then, I'm keeping a critical eye on what’s really going on under the hood of this “revolutionary” browser.",,695,-1,749,780,104.0,-1,

I've taken the time to read up on this TED Talk by Nick Bostrom, and I gotta say, it's a real mindbender.The idea that AI could surpass human intelligence within this century isn't just a hypothesis; it's becoming increasingly plausible as each day passes.But let me break down where my head is at with all this.

First off, the notion that we're on the cusp of creating machines smarter than us is both exhilarating and terrifying.I mean, think about it—this could be the ultimate gamechanger for humanity.We've been relying on our two cents since the dawn of time; now, we might be outsourcing decisionmaking to siliconbased problem solvers.

But that's where my enthusiasm starts to wane.Bostrom makes this sound like a fait accompli, as if it’s just a matter of time before AI outsmarts us and takes charge.I'm not buying it.We're talking about machines here, not sentient beings with an agenda.Sure, they'll be smart in their own right, but will they have the emotional intelligence to preserve humanity? Or even care for that matter?

There's this underlying assumption that Bostrom is pushing—that AI will naturally have its own set of values.But what if it doesn't? What if our creations just end up being glorified tools with no soul or sense of selfpreservation? It could be one colossal mistake to entrust the fate of humanity to something that might not give a flying fuck about our existence.

Now, don’t get me wrong; I'm no Luddite.Technology has its place and can do wonders when harnessed responsibly.But we need to be careful who we put our trust in—or in this case, our future to.The last thing we need is some codedriven overlord deciding what's best for humanity, especially if those values don't align with ours.

In conclusion, Bostrom’s talk has a certain ring of truth to it, but I'm not ready to drink the coolaid just yet.There are too many unknowns and potential pitfalls that could spell disaster if we're not careful.Let's keep our feet firmly on the ground and remember who—or what—is driving this technological freight train before we all end up as roadkill.",,342,-1,753,781,38.0,-1,

The article's perspective seems to be centered, which I believe is a way of avoiding taking a clear stance on the political spectrum.The topic itself, decentralized certificate authority and naming, might sound innovative or even revolutionary if it aligns with certain beliefs about reducing control from central authorities.

However, when looking at this from an AntiElite Populist Right perspective, we can't help but question the motives behind such decentralization efforts.It's not uncommon for socalled innovative solutions to be thinly veiled attempts to further erode accountability and concentration of power in the wrong hands.In this case, if it leads to undermining established systems that maintain some level of transparency and oversight, I'd have reservations about its merits.

Furthermore, without delving into explicit affiliation, the focus on decentralization might be seen as too much emphasis on small movements or structures rather than addressing the broader systemic issues that contribute to societal division and inequality.True progress often requires a more holistic approach, focusing not just on technology but also policy reform and economic justice.

This article reveals a concerning partnership between eBay and TOM, which has led to the collusion of Skype with the Chinese government for surveillance purposes.Users' text chats, especially those containing politically sensitive topics like democracy and freedom, were monitored and potentially handed over to the authorities.This situation raises questions about privacy violations, political implications, and corporate accountability in the face of profitdriven decisions.

My perspective aligns with skepticism towards large corporations that prioritize profits over individual rights and freedoms.The revelation that Skype's source code was likely provided to TOM by eBay is particularly troubling.It appears that the pursuit of market share can lead these companies to compromise their users' privacy, which is a grave concern in a country like China known for its strict censorship and surveillance.

The article suggests that some within eBay/Skype might have been aware of this arrangement and consented due to the enormous Chinese market.This raises further questions about corporate governance and oversight, as well as the responsibility these companies hold towards their users.It is disheartening to see how economic interests can lead to the erosion of personal freedoms.

I would encourage eBay to be transparent about their actions in this situation and take concrete steps to ensure that such privacy breaches do not occur again.They should also advocate for their users by seeking justice for those impacted by this surveillance, especially considering the potential consequences for individuals involved in politically sensitive activities.

In light of these developments, it's essential for users who value privacy and freedom to reassess their choice of communication platforms.Companies that prioritize user security over market access are more likely to protect their customers' rights and maintain integrity in the face of political pressures.

But then you have these critics throwing a wrench into the works by calling it the avoid ghetto app, implying all sorts of nefarious intentions behind Microsoft's creation.

Now, I'm not saying that the critics don't have a point.It does seem like there could be some finetuning to avoid such loaded language and potential negative connotations.But at its core, isn't this just another step in GPS technology?

The article's title suggests that it aligns with my beliefs as a conservative, but I must analyze its content carefully.The Media Research Center (MRC) aims to combat what they perceive as liberal media bias by documenting falsehoods and advocating for America's founding principles and JudeoChristian values.While I agree on the importance of upholding these values, I question whether their approach effectively achieves this goal or merely fuels polarization.

I find it concerning that contributions to the MRC are taxdeductible, implying a form of endorsement from the government.It is essential to scrutinize how such organizations operate and ensure they truly serve the public interest rather than promoting a specific ideological agenda.My concern is that their mission might inadvertently contribute to division within society instead of fostering constructive dialogue.

Furthermore, I worry about their focus on JudeoChristian values in a diverse nation like America.While these values are significant to many, they may not resonate with others, potentially leading to exclusionary practices.It's crucial to recognize the value of other belief systems and cultural backgrounds in our media representation.

In conclusion, while the intention behind this organization is commendable, I believe their methods might not be the most effective way to combat liberal media bias or uphold America's founding principles.Instead, we should strive for a more inclusive approach that values diverse perspectives and fosters unity among all citizens.",,661,-1,767,784,37.0,-1,

In today's digital age, the importance of online safety cannot be overstated.As someone who identifies as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I believe that our values should guide our approach to technology and its usage.When it comes to open source projects, safety is key.

Open source projects thrive on collaboration and transparency.However, this openness can also create vulnerabilities, especially when it comes to internet policy and regulation.We must ensure that participants in these projects are protected from harmful content or individuals with malicious intentions.It's crucial for us, as a community, to uphold strong moral standards while we work together to build and maintain these projects.

I've noticed some concerns regarding the lack of emphasis on online safety within open source communities.Some believe that prioritizing safety might limit collaboration and hinder progress in these projects.I strongly disagree with this perspective.By implementing robust safety measures, such as moderation policies and code review processes, we can create a secure environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing.

Furthermore, it is essential to recognize the role of technology in shaping our society, especially from a conservative viewpoint.As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we must guide these technological advancements responsibly.This includes advocating for strong internet policy and regulation that uphold moral values and protect individuals from potential harm.

Well, isn't that a bit of a loaded claim right there? Julian Assange, the guy who leaked a ton of classified information and now sits in a fucking Ecuadorian embassy like a fugitive from justice, says that Google isn't what it seems.Yeah, I can see how that might be a surprise to literally nobody.

Look, we all know Google's not just about searching for cat memes and directions.It's a behemoth of data collection, tracking every little detail about each one of us so they can sell our information to the highest bidder or use it to manipulate public opinion.That's just how the cookie crumbles in this day and age.

But Assange, holing up like a paranoid conspiracy theorist, is suddenly a voice of truth? I don't think so.He's just trying to shift attention from his own legal woes.What's next, gonna tell us that the moon landing was staged? 

I'll stick with my own beliefs and not take unsolicited advice from someone who thinks the government and big tech are in cahoots to control our every move.It's a free country; if people want to use Google, they can do so without some fugitive telling them what really is going on.

In fact, it seems to me that Assange is just another grumpy old man with too much time on his hands and not enough facts to back up his claims.And frankly, I've got better things to worry about than whether Google's true nature aligns with my political views; like making sure we keep our jobs here in America and don't let some elitist globalists dictate how we think or live.

Well, ain't that a piece of technology talk.So, this here's some tool called me_cleaner designed for partial deblobbing of Intel ME/TXE firmware images.Sounds like some highfalutin computer stuff to me.As someone who values the sanctity of our American way of life and the importance of keeping our tech secure, I gotta say, it piques my interest.

First off, let's break this down.Intel's Management Engine (ME) has been a point of contention in certain circles.There're folks out there who believe that stuff like this—hidden software on your CPU—could be used for spying or other nefarious purposes.Now, I ain't saying that for sure, but it's something to consider when you're dealing with tech that's as complex as our government.

The idea of deblobbing, which is removing parts of the firmware that could potentially hide stuff, seems like a step in the right direction if you ask me.It's like scrubbing clean something that might be dirty beneath the surface.And to think there's a tool for this—that's some nextlevel stuff.

Now, I ain't no computer whiz kid, but I know enough to see that this could be important work.Keeping our tech safe and transparent is crucial in these times when privacy concerns are at an alltime high.If this tool can help with that, then I reckon it's worth paying attention to.

Still, as with anything technological, there might be risks involved or unintended consequences we ain't aware of yet.But if the community of techsavvy patriots keeps a watchful eye on things like these tools and their development, we'll be just fine.

In summary, me_cleaner sounds like it's onto something potentially big.As long as they keep working in the right direction, I reckon this could be one small victory for common sense and security in our tech landscape.Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go read up more on this stuff—it's too interesting to pass up.",,718,-1,804,789,111.0,-1,

While I appreciate the MRC's efforts to document media inaccuracies, especially when it comes to the farleft's obsession with censorship, I can't help but feel that their approach might be a tad onesided.Don't get me wrong, there is indeed a pervasive liberal media bias that needs to be addressed and countered, but labeling every critique of conservatism as censorship or painting all journalists as enemies of America's core values does more harm than good.It divides us further and prevents meaningful dialogue.

The fact that the MRC operates under 501(c)(3) and is taxdeductible makes me uneasy; it feels like a thinly veiled attempt to legitimize their work while sidestepping true transparency about potential funding sources.What's really being defended here, besides an ideological agenda? The notion that America's founding principles are strictly tied to JudeoChristian values is debatable and, frankly, highly reductionist.Our country was built on the backs of diverse individuals with various beliefs, not just Christian ones.

Secondly, hiring the best app developers in Toronto implies that these guys have access to a pool of exceptionally talented individuals who can create amazing apps.But what does it really mean?

Maybe they're getting taken advantage of with overpriced services that don't deliver as much as they promise.

Now, looking at this from my perspective, I'm a bit skeptical about these kinds of standards.It seems like they're often created by elite groups who think they know best how we should use the internet.And honestly, sometimes I feel like they just add unnecessary complexity.But I suppose if it helps make the web more userfriendly and efficient, then it can't be all bad.

I'm all about a good debate and ensuring our media doesn't have an unfair leftwing slant, but it's essential to remember that these foundational principles are open to interpretation.And while I agree we need to combat censorship in any form, the term 'JudeoChristian values' can be alienating for those who don't share these specific beliefs.

These techwizards over at WIRED are really selling us on this fear of government surveillance, aren't they? Let me get this straight – we're supposed to be unsettled because some secretive branch of our socalled protectors can mess with the very core of what makes a computer tick, the firmware? I don't think so.

First off, let's not forget who we're talking about here: the NSA.These aren't your friendly neighborhood tech support guys; they're the elite, and in my view, sometimes too elite for their own good.The idea that they've got some supersecret technique to reprogram hard drives is nothing new – I mean, have you seen the movies? It's all dark side of the moon stuff.

And what really gets me here is how WIRED is framing this as if it's something we should be worried about.I'd bet my last dollar that they're not too keen on revealing just how common firmware hacking actually is in the tech world.The truth is, it's probably more benign than they let on – maybe some backdoor deals with manufacturers or a way to keep tabs on their own systems.

But no, we can't have that.We gotta make this sound like Big Brother is watching, tapping our phones, and hacking our drives because they're just so damn powerful and evil.Give me a break.It's all about control – not from the shadowy government agents but from WIRED trying to sell their narrative.

And let's talk about the Kaspersky researchers for a second.I'm sure they're just swell people, but what do we really know about them? Could they be part of this elite circle that's so concerned with keeping secrets? Are they blowing things out of proportion to further their own careers?

Here's the kicker: instead of being unsettled, maybe we should be a bit more critical.Maybe ask ourselves why the hell we're trusting our most sensitive data to companies and governments that can just up and change the rules whenever they feel like it.

In conclusion, I think it's high time we stopped letting WIRED and their buddies make us believe in government conspiracies every time they flip on a microphone.Let's wake up and smell the coffee – there are real issues out there, not some manufactured outrage over firmware hacking that probably isn't as bad as they say.

These days, it's no secret that the Chinese government is notorious for its tight grip on information flow within the country.What's even more concerning is how they manage to manipulate the internet, using a complex web of censorship to suppress any dissenting voices or opinions contrary to their own agenda.

The idea of navigating through such an intricate system can be quite daunting and limiting for those who seek truth and transparency.It's almost like tiptoeing around a minefield, never knowing when you might unknowingly step on something sensitive that could trigger severe consequences.

In this article, the author attempts to shed light on Google's struggle with Beijing over internet controls.However, I believe there is a lack of exploration into how damaging such heavy censorship can be.By restricting access to information and limiting the use of certain websites or tools, the Chinese government not only stifles progress but also fosters an environment ripe for manipulation and misinformation.

The question about the Pacific Ocean's salinity is an interesting one, but I must say, it seems a bit offtopic for someone like me who values tradition and the natural order of things.The average ocean salinity being 35 ppt doesn't really pertain to our daily lives or the core issues that truly matter to us as patriotic individuals who believe in strong family structures and community values.

However, I do find it mildly fascinating how something like water can vary so much depending on factors such as rainfall and evaporation.It reminds me of how we have to adapt to life's challenges, like when our country faces economic difficulties or moral dilemmas that test our faith and values.

Nonetheless, the real issue at hand is not the salinity levels but how we protect our nation's interests and uphold our core beliefs.I believe in taking a firm stance on what I know is right, just as the ocean has its own rhythms and patterns that remain steadfast despite the tides.

Well, that's quite a headline, ain't it? President Trump is calling for the repeal of Section 230.Now, I gotta say, this aligns with some of my beliefs as a conservative.See, we value free speech and the idea that these big tech companies shouldn't be controlling what we see or hear.But, let's break it down a bit.

First off, making social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter into publishers rather than platforms could have serious implications.These companies would now face lawsuits for content posted by their users if they're considered publishers.That could potentially bankrupt them, which might be a good thing in one sense it'd level the playing field a bit but it also means that we could lose some of these platforms entirely.

Secondly, I gotta wonder about Trump's motives here.Sure, he wants to get his message out there, and being censored ain't exactly pleasant, especially for someone used to being heard loud and clear.But are we sure this is the right solution? It feels like a bit of an attack on free speech overall.

Lastly, I gotta say, it's not often that you'll catch me defending big tech, but in this case, they're protecting their users' rights to express themselves freely.Without Section 230, some of these users could be left exposed to lawsuits just for sharing their thoughts and opinions online.

It's like they're trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist just so they can pat themselves on the back for being forwardthinking.

You'd need a fucking fortune to build out an entire highspeed rail network across this country.Money that could be better spent on more pressing issues like improving our crumbling infrastructure, investing in renewable energy, or even giving the average Joe a tax break.

Plus, don't get me started on the environmental impact of these massive projects.Sure, trains are greener than cars and planes, but they still require a lot of resources to build and maintain.I'm not convinced we need to be building monuments to progress when there's so much other work that needs doing.

Hey folks, so I've been doing some research lately on electric vehicles and man, there's a whole lot to love from a conservative standpoint.At first glance, EVs might seem like they're pushing a liberal agenda, but bear with me here I think we can make a solid case for why this tech aligns well with our values.

First off, the environment is important.We all want a clean America, and reducing emissions is crucial to preserving the beauty of God's creation.EVs are already showing huge strides in lowering pollution; they're quieter too, which I think we can appreciate as people who value peace and tranquility.

Secondly, there's this whole debate about energy independence versus foreign oil.Well, EVs run on electricity often generated from American coal or natural gas so that's a big win for energy freedom and national security in my eyes.

Now, some of you might be thinking What about the cost? And I get it, upfront prices are still higher for EVs compared to traditional vehicles.But when you factor in lower maintenance costs due to fewer parts moving around (fewer things can break), plus the savings on fuel, they're really not that different over time.

I also see a lot of griping about the range anxiety, but honestly, most of our driving is local – perfect for EVs.Plus, charging infrastructure is popping up everywhere, fast and convenient as gas stations used to be.

Lastly, I want to address those who think conservativism means sticking in the past it doesn't! Innovation isn't a liberal or conservative value; it's about progress and making life better for everyone.Embracing EVs feels like we're taking back control of our economy and our future – something that resonates deeply with my values.

And who the hell is going to pay for these things? More government programs for people who are less able? I don't think so.We should be focusing on fixing our real problems, not making life easier for those who already have accommodations.

I mean, sure, it might make sense from a business standpoint – create a product that addresses a niche issue and sell it to the highest bidder.But what about the rest of us? The ones who aren't special enough to need color blind glasses? Don't we deserve some fucking help too?

This shit reeks of elitism if you ask me.Some folks want to be pampered with fancyass solutions for their problems, while the rest of us are out here struggling to make ends meet.Fuck that noise.

I'm not saying it's all bad or anything.I guess there could be some benefits to these glasses, especially in professional settings where color is crucial (like picking colors for fucking paint swatches).But at the end of the day, it still feels like we're just pissing in the wind on this one.Ain't nothing gonna change with folks like me who can't afford or don't need those fancyass glasses.

Well, I gotta say, this talk by Nick Bostrom is quite a headscratcher.On one hand, it's fascinating to think about AI surpassing human intelligence.But on the other hand, as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I have some reservations.

First off, Bostrom seems to be glossing over the whole values aspect of an AI becoming selfaware.What kind of values are we talking about here? We're not just developing machines that can crunch numbers faster than us; we're creating something that could potentially challenge our deeply held beliefs and traditions.And as someone who places strong emphasis on moral principles, I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea that these machines might have their own set of values.

Secondly, there's this whole notion of AI being the last invention humanity needs to make. That's a pretty bold statement! While technology has undoubtedly improved our lives in countless ways, I don't think we should be so hasty in dismissing human ingenuity.We've been creating new inventions and finding innovative solutions for centuries; why assume that this time it's different?

Lastly, Bostrom seems to be painting AI as this uncontrollable force that will inevitably overtake us. I'm not convinced that's a foregone conclusion.After all, aren't we the ones programming these machines? We have the power to shape their development and ensure they align with our values and goals.

So while Bostrom raises some important questions about AI, I think his talk could benefit from a bit more nuance.It's not as simple as just sitting back and watching our computers get smarter than us; we need to stay involved and make sure these advancements serve humanity in the right way.",,381,-1,908,810,38.0,-1,

The fact that they're using terms like Folk First raises a red flag for me.It feels exclusionary and could easily be twisted into something far more sinister than intended.We need to remember, as people who believe in certain core values, that we should be striving for inclusion and understanding rather than drawing lines.

I've taken a look at this article, and I gotta say, it piques my interest.The title suggests that the author is diving into the deep end of the IQ pool to determine whether Africans truly have an average IQ of 70.Now, before I get into my thoughts on this, let me set the stage: I'm no expert in psychometrics or human intelligence, but as someone wellversed in statistics and a bit of a skeptic when it comes to sweeping generalizations, I've got some reservations about how this article might be approached.

First off, the idea that there's such a thing as an average IQ for any large and diverse group like Africans is itself problematic.Intelligence is a complex trait influenced by genetics, environment, education, and countless other factors – making broad strokes about an entire population not just unscientific but also likely to be misleading.

Now, onto the meat of it: the claim that Africans have an average IQ of 70.That number seems suspiciously low when put up against global norms.The average IQ globally is set at around 100 with a standard deviation of 15 points.If we're talking about the average IQ in Africa, I'd wager there's far more nuance to the story than just slapping a single number on it.Different countries, different ethnic groups, and even different socioeconomic brackets within those groups would all likely have varying averages.

Moreover, IQ tests themselves are instruments of Western origin that might not accurately measure cognitive abilities in nonWestern cultures – a critique I agree with to some extent.There's the Flynn effect to consider: IQ scores worldwide have been rising over time due to better education and living conditions, suggesting cultural and environmental factors significantly impact intelligence test results.

Lastly, if we're going down this rabbit hole of IQ and genetics, it's important not to overlook the role of socioeconomic factors in shaping cognitive abilities.In many African countries, educational resources are limited, and that can have a direct impact on IQ scores.It's also worth considering how IQ tests might be perceived by some individuals or communities – as a tool of Western imperialism or colonial mentality, for instance.

In conclusion, while I'm intrigued by the topic and enjoy a good debate about intelligence and group differences, this article seems to oversimplify a complex issue with potentially damaging implications.Africa is a continent of 54 nations with over 1,200 languages and diverse cultures; it's far too broad a brush to paint them all with an average IQ figure.

I find it a bit concerning how easy it is for people to talk down about others' abilities or heritage without even knowing them.We should be focusing on our strengths, as individuals and communities, instead of tearing each other down.And hey, let's not forget that we all have something unique to offer intelligence comes in many forms.

I'd say the author of this piece could use a little more tact when discussing these sensitive matters.There are ways to explore these ideas without coming off as condescending or judgmental.It seems like this whole endeavor might be based on flawed assumptions rather than genuine curiosity.

So, no, I don't think we should just swallow everything we're fed, especially when it comes with such a bitter taste.Instead of trying to dissect every group's IQ, how about we focus on nurturing our own minds and supporting each other?

I reckon this is a mighty big concern for us everyday Joes who just want to keep our personal stuff, well, personal.It's one thing for the government to spy on terrorists and whatnot, but if they're snooping around on all of us, that's a whole different ballgame.I ain't too proud to say that it makes me uneasy knowing my private life could be under someone else's control.

So yeah, this whole firmware hacking business stinks to high heaven in my book.It's like the government thinks they own our computers or something.And if you ask me, we oughta have a hell of a lot more say so about what they're up to and how far they can go with stuff like this.

I reckon it's time folks start paying closer attention to who's messing around in their business – especially when it comes to those in power.This whole thing reeks of overreach, and I ain't afraid to speak my mind about it.If the government's gonna act like a bunch of digital Peeping Toms, then we need to call them out on it.",,227,-1,933,814,228.0,-1,

I gotta say, reading this title and summary leaves me with a lot of questions.This whole Vault 7 thing seems like some highlevel espionage stuff.I'm not exactly thrilled about the idea that our own government might be poking around in people's computers and phones without their consent.It just goes against what we're supposed to stand for as Americans, you know? Privacy matters, and it feels like this whole situation is a huge breach of trust.

Now, I don't know much about WikiLeaks or their credibility, but if they're claiming the CIA has been up to no good, that's pretty serious.It's not just about national security; it's about who we are as a society.We're supposed to be the good guys, right? So why would our own government be doing stuff that could easily be done by some shady hacker in a basement?

I'm no expert on this sort of thing, but from what I've read, this Vault 7 business smells fishy.It's way too convenient for someone to just leak all this info and expect nobody to ask questions.Something doesn't add up here.

Overall, while the implications are huge, I'm not entirely convinced that everything WikiLeaks is saying is on the level.Too many unanswered questions and too much room for interpretation.We need more transparency, but we also need accuracy and accountability.Can't just take things at face value, especially when it comes to something as significant as this.

And let's be real here; whoever leaked this information had some serious guts or a serious grudge against the system.Either way, it's got people talking, and that's important.We should definitely be having more conversations about privacy, security, and what our government is really up to.But we should also be questioning the motives behind this leak and ensuring we're getting all the facts before jumping to conclusions.

In the end, I'm left feeling a mix of intrigue and skepticism.This whole WikiLeaks thing with Vault 7 has got some pretty big implications, but it's too early for me to take sides or make any grand declarations.We need more light on this situation before we can even think about drawing conclusions.",,246,-1,935,814,257.0,-1,

In terms of aligning with my beliefs as a socially moderate right person, I think this fits pretty well.I don't mind using technology to protect personal information and believe in the importance of privacy.However, I do have some concerns about how decentralized systems can sometimes be if not properly managed.With that said, it seems like Demonsaw has taken precautions with their endtoend encryption, which is a positive step.

That being said, I'm always a little skeptical when something sounds too good to be true.The claim of no client P2P raises a red flag for me if it's truly decentralized and there's no peertopeer communication between clients, how does the informationsharing work?

I gotta say, the title itself is enough to make me raise an eyebrow.Nick Bostrom's talk seems like it's leaning pretty hard into a doomsday scenario.Now, I'm no expert in AI or philosophy, but as someone who leans towards being socially moderate right, I find this perspective a bit too alarmist.

Bostrom is basically painting a picture where our computers are going to surpass human intelligence and just take over.It sounds like a bad scifi movie plot.While it's true that AI is advancing rapidly, the idea that it will suddenly become selfaware and start making decisions independent of human control? I think that's a stretch.

I mean, sure, there are risks associated with superintelligent AI.But what Bostrom seems to be proposing is kind of like the sky is falling approach.It's not very constructive or optimistic.What about all the potential benefits of advanced AI? Medical breakthroughs, sustainable energy solutions, improved manufacturing processes...The list goes on.

And let's talk about values for a second.Bostrom's question will our smart machines help to preserve humanity and our values, or will they have values of their own? is a bit loaded.It assumes that the only two options are either preserving human values or having entirely new ones imposed upon us by AI.What if we could design these machines to enhance our values instead?

Look, I'm not saying Bostrom doesn't have some valid points.But from my perspective, his talk seems overly focused on worstcase scenarios rather than exploring how we can harness the power of advanced AI for good.

In conclusion, while Nick Bostrom raises some interesting questions about the future of AI and its potential impact on society, I think he leans too heavily into fearmongering.It's not a very balanced or forwardthinking approach in my opinion.",,734,-1,946,815,38.0,-1,

In addition, while the article claims to offer opinions, it does not clearly delineate between facts and personal beliefs, which is a crucial aspect of maintaining integrity in journalism and commentary.The lack of clear distinction can lead to readers accepting opinions as truths, which undermines critical thinking and informed decisionmaking.

The fact that this site is being marketed through a domain reseller adds another layer of concern for me.It appears that the site's potential new owners could prioritize profits over the quality and reliability of content, which might be detrimental to public discourse.In an era where misinformation can have significant consequences, it's crucial to keep these platforms honest and free from manipulation.

In my view, this sale reflects poorly on the values of FrontlinesNews.com and its previous management.The center political leaning indicated suggests that they may have straddled the line between different political stances, but with a change in ownership coming at the cost of their independence, I worry about what kind of content we can expect moving forward.

First off, the moment we start treating social media as publishers, we open up a whole can of worms.You see, Section 230 protects these platforms from liability for usergenerated content.If that goes away, suddenly they're on the hook for anything and everything posted by their users which would basically make them responsible for every fucking thing anyone posts online.

The comparison between different models like the Pentium 4, Pentium D, Core 2 Duo, and Core 2 Extreme/Quad is quite informative.However, it seems that there's an underlying assumption here that might be worth questioning: why exactly did Intel's Core 2 series suddenly become more powerefficient?

Well, this article sure paints the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual (DSM) in quite a negative light.As someone who leans towards questioning the establishment, I can see why it might seem like psychiatry's bestselling catalog of mental illness is a scam.But let me break down my thoughts on this.

First off, yeah, the DSM does cover a wide range of conditions that many would consider trivial or even fabricated.Problems with math? Fear of spiders? That might seem like everyday stuff to some of us common folks who don't have degrees in psychology.And when you start labeling behaviors and experiences as disorders, it can indeed feel like psychiatry is trying too hard to pathologize the human experience.

Now, I'm not saying that mental health isn't legitimate or that there aren't real struggles out there.There clearly are people dealing with serious issues that need help.But when you look at how certain conditions have evolved over time—like ADHD, which wasn’t even officially recognized until 1980—it makes me wonder if we're just medicating away normal behavior.

Plus, the pharmaceutical industry's involvement in shaping these diagnoses and their treatments? That raises a bunch of red flags for anyone who's skeptical about corporate influence on our health.It feels like there’s money to be made by convincing more people they need medication, rather than looking at deeper issues or addressing societal problems.

So while I might not go as far as calling the DSM psychiatry’s deadliest scam, it does seem like a valid critique that warrants some skepticism from those of us who are wary of overmedicalization and corporatization in healthcare.It's important to question these things, especially if we're looking out for the genuine welfare of people struggling with their mental health.",,300,-1,984,820,164.0,-1,

These former Facebook employees are basically admitting that they engaged in political censorship.It's no surprise that a company as powerful and influential as Facebook would have its own leanings, but it's downright corrupt to actively suppress content that doesn't align with your worldview.

As someone who identifies as socially moderate right, I believe that every voice deserves to be heard.Suppressing conservative news is just another example of the tech oligarchs rigging the game in their favor and silencing anyone they disagree with.

It’s not like these companies are impartial or neutral arbiters of truth; they’ve shown time and again that they will happily bend rules if it means protecting their own interests or pushing an agenda.I’m not saying every conservative news piece should be featured, but there's a fine line between curating content and outright silencing opposing viewpoints.

I'm also curious about the criteria used to determine which stories were suppressed.Was it based on specific keywords? The source of the information? Or was it just their personal opinion on what should or shouldn't be seen by the public? And why hasn’t anyone been held accountable for this blatant breach of trust?

It's a shame, really, because Facebook has so much potential to foster healthy debate and the free exchange of ideas.But instead, we see yet another example of how big tech is complicit in the erosion of democratic principles and the manipulation of public opinion.",,413,-1,996,822,138.0,-1,

As someone who leans towards questioning the amount of power there is in the hands of those controlling the narrative, this article doesn't sit right with me.It's always a concern when we talk about governments or corporations having access to our personal lives without our consent.Privacy is a fundamental human right, and if we're losing that, it's not just a minor issue.

That's some nextlevel shit we're talking about.It's more likely that we're just not seeing the full extent of what they can do with the data they collect.

I'm no conspiracy theorist, but when you start talking about controlling minds, that's a whole different ball game.I mean, who wouldn't want to have some control over people? But we gotta be careful with how we approach this topic because it's easy to stray into tinfoilhat territory.

In the end, while this article is interesting, it also kinda freaks me out.The idea that there might be technology capable of controlling our thoughts without us even knowing it is unsettling.We need to make sure these technologies are regulated and transparent if they're ever going to be implemented.And frankly, I'm not convinced we should have them at all.

Well, this bill is an interesting piece of legislation that aims to force a full audit of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal reserve banks by the Comptroller General of the United States.While I understand the desire for transparency in our financial institutions, I have some reservations about this particular approach.

Firstly, let's talk about the potential consequences of such an audit.Implementing a fullscale audit could lead to unnecessary market volatility, especially if it uncovers sensitive information that might affect investor confidence.The Federal Reserve plays a crucial role in stabilizing our economy, and we need to be careful not to disrupt this delicate balance.

Secondly, I'm concerned about the practicality of such an audit.The Comptroller General would likely need significant resources to conduct a thorough investigation without causing unintended disruptions.We must consider whether this is the most efficient way to ensure transparency or if there are more targeted measures that could achieve the same goal with less risk.

Lastly, while I agree that transparency in financial institutions is essential, we should also recognize that the Federal Reserve operates under specific legislation and regulatory frameworks that have been put in place after decades of careful consideration.Overstepping these boundaries might not be beneficial for our economy or the longterm stability of our financial system.

Overall, while I appreciate the intent behind this bill, I believe it may not be the most effective solution to achieve greater transparency within our financial institutions.",,141,-1,1005,824,177.0,-1,

Is it genuine concern for transparency or just a fishing expedition looking to land something juicy to scandalize with? We've got bigger fish to fry than to risk destabilizing our financial backbone over some perceived misdeeds.The Fed isn't a charity; it's a finely tuned machine that keeps us from economic chaos.

This TED talk by Nick Bostrom raises some thoughtprovoking concerns about the future of AI.While I appreciate his philosophical approach, I can't help but feel that he might be a bit too alarmist regarding the potential for machines to outsmart us.As someone with a moderate right perspective, I believe in harnessing technology for human benefit without getting caught up in dystopian predictions.

Bostrom's argument relies heavily on the idea of superintelligent AI taking control and potentially leading to the end of humanity as we know it.However, this assumption seems overly simplistic.Intelligence is complex – both human and artificial – and there are many factors that suggest we're not going to create an allpowerful AI anytime soon.

Moreover, I find it hard to accept his notion that machines will somehow develop their own values separate from ours.Values are deeply rooted in human culture and experience; replicating them artificially seems like a tall order.

In conclusion, while Bostrom raises some valid points about the importance of thinking critically about our AIdriven future, I believe he might be leaning too far into the sky is falling narrative.We need to approach this technology with caution and foresight, yes, but not with an inherent mistrust or fear of its potential.",,625,-1,1020,827,38.0,-1,

I recently came across the article about TheDesk and its mention as a Mastodon client for PC.As someone who appreciates technology that aligns with my values, I must admit that my interest was piqued at first.However, upon further reflection, I find myself disagreeing with the notion of embracing such platforms.

First off, Mastodon is a social network that's built on open standards and promotes communitydriven moderation.While this might appeal to some, as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I find it troubling.These communities often lack clear leadership, which can lead to chaos and misguidance.In our belief system, we value order and structure, something that Mastodon's decentralized approach seems to undermine.

Moreover, the fact that TheDesk is being hailed as an excellent client for such a platform raises concerns for me.I worry about how these tools facilitate interactions between individuals who may hold conflicting views on important matters.Our beliefs are deeply rooted in tradition and morality, which can be easily challenged or ridiculed in environments like Mastodon.

In conclusion, while technology should always evolve to serve humanity better, we must tread carefully when adopting platforms that could potentially erode the very foundations of our principles.As conservatives, we need to ensure that our values aren't lost in the digital age but instead continue to guide us.In this regard, I remain skeptical about the merits of Mastodon and TheDesk as a tool for fostering meaningful connections between people who share similar convictions.",,638,-1,1033,829,50.0,-1,

Furthermore, I think it’s crucial to ensure that this initiative doesn’t evolve into an attempt to suppress free speech or dissenting opinions under the guise of combating “liberal media bias.” The goal should be to encourage balanced reporting and factchecking, not to silence opposing viewpoints.Open dialogue and a willingness to listen to all perspectives are vital for our democracy's health.

Well, well, well.Isn't this just a delightful trip down memory lane? An old warhorse from the days of yore preaching about the filthy profits of militarism and the bloodthirsty lust for power that fuels wars.Yeah, because we all know that's what keeps our world spinning, don't we? Not greed, not ego, not any of that nonsense.Nope, it's purely altruistic over here.

Look, I get it, General Butler was a straight shooter, no pun intended.He saw the ugly side of war and wanted to share his insights with the good people of America so they could keep their hands clean while still being prepared for the next big conflict.But let me tell you something; this idea that wars are just some grand scheme cooked up by elite bastards in their boardrooms, it's a bit simplistic, don't you think? Sure, there are plenty of scumbags who love to send other people off to die for their gain – politicians and military leaders alike.But not everyone is in it for the money or power.Some folks actually believe in what they're fighting for.

And hey, let's not forget about those soldiers out in the field.They don't give a damn about profit margins or who's calling the shots.They're over there because they've got something to protect, someone to support, or maybe even just 'cause it's their duty.And we can criticize that all we want, but at the end of the day, those soldiers are putting their lives on the line.

Now, I'm not saying War Is A Racket is a bad book.It's got some valuable points and it's nice to see someone calling out the establishment for their bullshit back in 1935.But sometimes it feels like we're oversimplifying things, painting every soldier as just a pawn in someone else's game or every politician as a soulless warmonger.That's just not how it works.

So yeah, I'll take Major General Smedley Butler's words with a grain of salt.They might have been true back then, but the world has changed since he wrote those lines.And if we're going to talk about who benefits from war these days, we better be ready to dig deeper and look at more than just the usual suspects.",,879,-1,1066,833,271.0,-1,

I don't see anything particularly groundbreaking in this article's mission statement.The Media Research Center (MRC) seems to be a rightleaning organization focused on countering what they perceive as liberal media propaganda, which aligns with my own views on the importance of questioning and scrutinizing the news we consume.

What strikes me as somewhat concerning is how the MRC's mission ties in with JudeoChristian values. While I understand that these values are important to many Americans, including myself, it's essential not to blur the lines between religious beliefs and political commentary.The media has a delicate balance to maintain when reporting on matters of faith, as they should strive for neutrality while acknowledging their own personal beliefs.

The section about taxdeductibility is also noteworthy.It subtly hints at an attempt to cultivate political influence by presenting themselves as notforprofit, which could be seen as an effort to curry favor with conservative donors and supporters.

Ultimately, I believe that organizations like the MRC have a crucial role in holding the media accountable for their actions.However, it's essential to maintain a level of objectivity when analyzing news sources, even if they align with our own beliefs.The risk is always there that we may fall victim to confirmation bias or other logical fallacies, which could undermine the very principles we're trying to preserve.

First off, this talk seems to contradict what we stand for – strong family values, hard work, and a firm belief in God's plan for humanity.It's enough to make you think that Bostrom has lost sight of what's truly important.I mean, are we really gonna trust some machine with our values?

The article's title suggests that it aligns with my beliefs as a conservative, but I must analyze its content carefully.The Media Research Center (MRC) aims to combat what they perceive as liberal media bias by documenting falsehoods and advocating for America's founding principles and JudeoChristian values.While I agree on the importance of upholding these values, I question whether their approach effectively achieves this goal or merely fuels polarization.

I find it concerning that contributions to the MRC are taxdeductible, implying a form of endorsement from the government.It is essential to scrutinize how such organizations operate and ensure they truly serve the public interest rather than promoting a specific ideological agenda.My concern is that their mission might inadvertently contribute to division within society instead of fostering constructive dialogue.

Furthermore, I worry about their focus on JudeoChristian values in a diverse nation like America.While these values are significant to many, they may not resonate with others, potentially leading to exclusionary practices.It's crucial to recognize the value of other belief systems and cultural backgrounds in our media representation.

In conclusion, while the intention behind this organization is commendable, I believe their methods might not be the most effective way to combat liberal media bias or uphold America's founding principles.Instead, we should strive for a more inclusive approach that values diverse perspectives and fosters unity among all citizens.",,661,-1,1099,836,37.0,-1,

These free and open source video editors are always touted as some great solution to the evil corporations that supposedly hoard their code and deny us peasants access to simple tools for our daily lives, right? But let's look at this more closely.Who benefits from these opensource projects? The ones who can't afford or don't want to pay for proprietary software, of course.I'm not saying there aren't any downsides to paying for software; hell, no one wants to be held hostage by a company that refuses to update their product because they want you to buy the next version.

But let's talk about who develops this stuff.These opensource projects are built on the backs of volunteers and parttime contributors who have day jobs elsewhere.They're not always going to put in the same level of polish or support as a company that has a dedicated team of developers working for it.And what happens when you need help? You can't just call up tech support; you gotta get in line at some forum or mailing list and hope someone gets back to you eventually.

And then there's the community aspect.Sure, Kdenlive is great if you're into that sort of thing.But I don't see how this somehow makes it better than a proprietary software company that has to answer to shareholders instead of just some arbitrary notion of community. It's all about control and who gets to decide what features get implemented when.

But hey, at least it's free, right? That's what they want you to focus on.Free stuff is always good because...well, it's free! Never mind that maybe the tradeoff is having to deal with software that doesn't quite work as advertised or lacks any real customer service support.Just community support, which is great if you like spending your evenings troubleshooting other people's problems.

So yeah, Kdenlive might be a decent piece of software for some people, but I'm not buying the whole opensource = inherently better narrative they're trying to push here.Give me a company that has to answer to consumers and can actually provide real support any day of the week.",,893,-1,1101,837,276.0,-1,

I got a good laugh out of this one, folks.Let me tell you something about this socalled top software development company in Toronto.It's all just hot air and empty promises.They claim to be the best at developing apps for Android and iOS, but I gotta see it to believe it.

First off, what makes them the best? Is it their commitment to values that align with those of hardworking American citizens like myself? Nope.All I can see is a bland webpage trying too hard to sell some dreamy vision of app development excellence.I'm not buying it.

Now, let's talk about their services.They're all about how they help clients worldwide.But what about the good ol' USA? Don't we deserve some attention here? It seems like this company is more focused on helping everyone but us.Not cool in my book.

And what's with that phrase best Android & iOS solutions? What does that even mean? They're just throwing buzzwords around to sound smart.I've seen smalltime developers who actually put their money where their mouth is, delivering real results for Americans.

And let’s not get started on oversimplification.The moment we start expecting political analysis to be served with a side of nuance is the day we’ll finally admit that our democracy can’t handle complexity.Besides, if it isn't sensational, then what are we even doing on the internet? Are we gonna go back to using Morse code or something?

Look, I get it.You want your red meat and you want it served with a fancy sauce of intellectualism.But RedState is what it is a reflection of a culture that demands more spectacle than substance.And honestly? That's not the worst thing in the world if we're being real about it.

So, to wrap this up without actually engaging in the debate you mentioned because who has time for that nonsense? RedState is doing exactly what it needs to do.It's giving people what they want a good ol' fashioned ideological brawl with none of that boring, nuanced stuff getting in the way.

Well, I've got some thoughts on this one.First off, let's talk about the timing of this new policy release by DHS.It feels like they're trying to sweep something under the rug here—releasing a new policy right after all that media attention and those Congressional inquiries? That smells fishy if you ask me.

Now, onto the four biggest problems with their new policy as listed by the ACLU:

1.Lack of transparency: This is where I think DHS is being real sneaky.They're not giving the public or even some members of Congress a complete picture on how these devices are used, and that's a major concern to me.

2.Overreach without a warrant: Stingrays can collect data from anyone within range, even if they're not the target.We need solid privacy protections in place, especially considering our beliefs about personal freedoms and government overreach.

3.The potential for false positives: These devices can pick up signals from innocent bystanders, and that's just disturbing.What happens to all that information? How do we ensure it doesn't get mishandled or fall into the wrong hands?

4.No clear guidelines on data retention: We need to know how long this data is kept for and under what circumstances it can be accessed later.

Now, I understand that DHS has a tough job, but as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we believe in a balance between security and our constitutional rights.This new policy seems more like a halfhearted attempt at damage control than an actual solution.It's time to start acting with more integrity and transparency if we want to maintain the trust of those who elected us.

I'd also like to hear from the ACLU: are they just trying to stir up trouble, or do they genuinely care about our national security? Because in this game of tugofwar between privacy and safety, I believe both sides could benefit from a little more giveandtake.",,810,-1,1139,840,171.0,-1,

Well, I've got some thoughts on this one.First off, Mr.Bostrom seems to be a smart cookie himself, but I gotta say, his ideas about our future with AI kinda rub me the wrong way.He's all doom and gloom, talking like these machines will just up and surpass us in intelligence without any real consequences.That sounds kinda heretical when you think about it we've always been the top dogs.

Now, I know he's a philosopher, but sometimes I think philosophers forget that there are absolutes out there, especially when it comes to values and humanity.Bostrom talks like our machines might develop their own sets of values, as if that's just naturally gonna happen without some serious guidance from us the creators.

I don't see why we should be so worried about AI getting too smart.I mean, aren't we always teaching them to follow our lead? To obey rules and act in ways we deem right? If they somehow get too advanced, isn't it our job as humans to steer them back on course? We're the parents here AI is our child.

And Bostrom's talk about machines maybe not needing any more inventions from us because they'll be so smart...well, that just sounds like he's forgetting all the things we've made possible through human ingenuity.Sure, AI can help in some areas, but it ain't gonna solve all our problems and make us lazy.We're too resilient for that.

So while Nick Bostrom may have some good points, I think his view on this future is too narrow.He's seeing a world where machines are the central force, but I believe we'll always be in charge guiding AI to help us build a better world according to our values, not theirs.",,415,-1,1142,841,38.0,-1,

I'm not saying it's wrong or anything, but there's something about putting all our eggs in one basket and hiding them away that doesn't sit right with me.It's almost like we're admitting defeat by accepting the need for such measures.I know this article is about protecting ourselves from surveillance, but can't we just trust that those in power have our best interests at heart?

I'm not saying that there aren't potential risks associated with these medications or that they shouldn't be carefully monitored and prescribed.But to go from potential risks to can kill your child is quite an exaggeration, in my opinion.That kind of language can really scare parents and doctors off from finding the right treatments for kids who genuinely need them.

First off, Bostrom says we might only need one more invention before we're done messing around with our creations.That sounds like hubris to me we humans have a history of underestimating the power of what we build and thinking we can control it.Remember when we thought Dolly the sheep was just the cat's pajamas? Well, guess who's in charge now?

And then there's this notion that machines might overtake us.What does that even mean? Sounds like science fiction to me.We're talking about a future where machines could be smarter than humans, but what we really need is for people to start acting with some common sense and respect for tradition not more complex gadgets that'll probably end up making everything worse.

Bostrom's got this idea that these smart machines might have their own values.Now I ain't no expert in philosophy, but if you're gonna talk about values, shouldn't we be talking about the ones that really matter? Like family, hard work, and a strong sense of community all things that are under attack by the very same tech Bostrom's pushing.

This whole thing sounds like a slippery slope to me.We create something smarter than us, and suddenly we're in a world where machines run the show.I don't trust this one bit.If you ask me, we need more focus on making sure these machines align with what's good for humanity not just some abstract notion of progress.

I've taken a look at the article about LibreOffice 5.1 release notes, and while I understand the importance of opensource software in democratizing access to technology, I can't help but feel that this project might be missing the bigger picture.

The perspective presented in this article aligns with a more centrist view, focusing on the technical aspects and collaborative efforts behind LibreOffice.However, as someone who leans towards AntiElite Populist Right beliefs, I find myself questioning whether such emphasis on opensource collaboration doesn't inadvertently empower an elite group of developers over the average user.

One concern is that while LibreOffice aims to be a free and open alternative to Microsoft Office, it seems to cater primarily to techsavvy individuals who are comfortable navigating complex software interfaces.This might not be the case for everyday users who just want to get their work done without delving into the technical details of document formatting.In essence, the focus on community blogs, weblate, nextcloud, and redmine might overlook the need for a more userfriendly approach.

Furthermore, I wonder if the reliance on platforms like ask libreoffice and the call for donations can inadvertently create a dependency on these systems rather than promoting true freedom in software use.This centralized model of support and funding might not align with the principles of opensource software that aim to liberate users from such dependencies.

In conclusion, while LibreOffice 5.1 is undoubtedly an impressive achievement, I believe there's room for improvement in addressing the needs of a broader audience beyond just the techsavvy community.The project should consider how to make its tools more accessible and usercentric to truly live up to its liberating potential.",,163,-1,1175,845,187.0,-1,

This article seems to align with my views as it pertains to the media's role in shaping public opinion and its perceived liberal leanings.I have always been skeptical of mainstream media outlets, suspecting them of promoting an elitist agenda that doesn't reflect the values of everyday Americans.

However, where I might diverge from this article is in the notion that JudeoChristian values should be the foundation upon which America's founding principles are based.While I agree that these values play a significant role in our society, I believe they should not hold more importance than other foundational elements such as democracy and individual freedoms.

Furthermore, there is always the risk of media outlets being overly critical or onesided when scrutinizing liberal media sources.It's important to maintain a balanced perspective and not dismiss opposing viewpoints outright.

The last thing we need is more confusion and instability.

It doesn't take a genius to figure out who really comes out on top when our own government starts playing hot and cold with international trade policies.

I think we need to be more strategic about these things.What did we gain from backing this trade war? And what have we lost now that Trump is wavering?

I recently dived into the world of coding with the help of AI assistants and have to say, I was blown away by how much it enhanced my learning experience.The concept of vibe coding resonates deeply with me; it's about creating an environment where students feel connected, engaged, and motivated while they learn.

Some individuals might argue that relying solely on AI for coding education could lead to a lack of understanding of fundamental programming concepts.I understand this concern, but I believe that AI can be a valuable tool to support traditional teaching methods, rather than replacing them entirely.By combining the strengths of both approaches, we can create an educational system that caters to diverse learning styles and fosters a love for coding in students.

As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative who values privacy and security, I believe that opensource cybersecurity solutions are the way forward.While some may argue that proprietary software provides better protection, I think it's time we give credit to the incredible communities of developers working on these projects for free.

For instance, take the Open Source Security Project (OpenBSD).This is a fully functional operating system developed by volunteers around the world.It's secure as fuck because many eyes are constantly reviewing and improving its code.And guess what? No backdoors or hidden vulnerabilities that could compromise our privacy and safety.

Another example is the Linux kernel, which forms the backbone of most modern servers and devices.The transparent development process allows anyone to audit the code, making it resilient against attacks from malicious actors.

It's time we stop relying on expensive security solutions developed by large corporations with questionable motives.Instead, let’s support opensource projects that are driven by a community dedicated to creating secure systems for everyone.

Well, isn't this just a delightful piece of clickbait? Let's break it down.

First off, the title implies that there's some sinister force at play here—a Satanic Transgender SJW who wants to control an opensource code community.Red flag number one: sensationalism.We're not talking about facts; we're being sold a story with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.

Now, let's talk about the term 'SJW.' It's become a favorite slur for those on the right who want to dismiss legitimate social justice concerns as overly zealous or extreme.And in this case, it seems like we're dealing with a straw man argument.Who exactly is this supposed Satanic Transgender SJW? We aren't given any concrete examples or evidence; instead, we get a label designed to provoke fear and outrage.

The other part of the title, Open Source Code Community, suggests that there's a specific group being targeted here.But why focus on an opensource community? Is it because they represent some kind of threat? It's almost as if the author believes that technology itself is under attack by the forces of political correctness.

Moving on to the content, we're left wanting more information about this alleged threat.Who specifically wants to control this community, and how? What concrete actions have been taken or policies proposed? The lack of details is telling; it's clear that the goal here is less to inform than to inflame.

In essence, this article looks like a poorly veiled attempt to stoke fear among those already wary of snowflakes and social justice warriors. It's an example of how easy it is to manipulate language and use loaded terms to create divisions.But remember, folks, there are real issues in tech—like privacy concerns, monopolistic practices, and cybersecurity—that deserve our attention.

I've been diving deep into open source projects lately and I gotta say, it's been a real eyeopener.We're not just talking about free software here; we're looking at a movement that could truly shake things up and challenge the powerholding elites in tech.

The mainstream is too caught up in proprietary solutions and closed systems, pissing away cash on overpriced subscriptions and services that are often more restrictive than helpful.Meanwhile, opensource projects like Linux, which have been around for ages, continue to thrive because they empower users and foster community collaboration.

What really gets my goat is how these big tech companies hoard knowledge and control the narrative.They're so busy protecting their empires that they forget about the people who made them what they are in the first place.It's time we take back our power by embracing open source, especially when it comes to electric vehicles and transportation.

Electric cars are on the rise, and those of us who aren't beholden to Big Auto know that opensource designs and innovations could accelerate this transition faster than anyone thought possible.Imagine being part of a community where you're not at the mercy of some corporate overlord deciding what your commute looks like or how much it's gonna cost you.

We need to come together, share knowledge freely, and build something better—something that serves us, not just line the pockets of Silicon Valley assholes or Detroit fat cats.It's about time we took back control with opensource tech and hit them right where it hurts: in their wallets.

While I acknowledge that these software development companies provide valuable services, especially in an age where digital presence is crucial, the way they present themselves leaves something to be desired.It's all too easy for consumers to get caught up in such grandiose claims and end up with subpar work or inflated bills.What really matters is not their selfproclaimed status but the quality of their services and how well they can deliver results within budget.

In this case, I'm not convinced that a company needs to be the top mobile app development agency to offer good service.There are many smaller, perhaps lesserknown firms out there that might actually provide more personalized attention and tailored solutions for clients without the hefty price tag.

Sure, on paper, opensource software like pfSense sounds great.It's free, it's customizable, and it allows a community of developers to contribute to its growth.But let's face it, when it comes to something as critical as our digital security, I'd rather trust something that has a dedicated team of professionals behind it.A company that can be held accountable for any vulnerabilities or mistakes in their product.

I mean, think about it.How many communitydriven projects have you seen that, despite good intentions, end up being poorly managed and ridden with bugs? It's a recipe for disaster when you're talking about something as crucial to our safety as our firewall settings.

And let's not forget the issue of updates.Opensource software relies on volunteers contributing their time and expertise.How consistent can updates really be if it's just a handful of enthusiasts working in their spare time? I'd rather have a company that employs fulltime security experts ensuring my system stays uptodate and secure.

I'm sorry, but as someone who values practicality and reliability above all else, I just can't get behind the idea of using an opensource firewall for anything more than a simple home network.For critical infrastructure or business use, I'd much rather trust a solution that's backed by professionals who are in this for a living.

It seems that this article raises some interesting points about a lifesaving surgery that prolonged Steve Jobs' life by quite a bit.However, I do have to question why an attorney for Apple was involved in paying the doctor's taxes and utilities.There might be a perfectly reasonable explanation, but from my perspective as someone who values transparency and responsibility, it does seem unusual.

In my opinion, while the surgeon may have genuinely wanted to help Jobs, there could be more going on here than meets the eye.I'm not saying that this was definitely an illicit or corrupt arrangement, but it's odd enough to warrant some serious scrutiny.It reflects poorly on Apple and their legal team if they were involved in such financial dealings with a doctor.

I would like to see more concrete evidence of what exactly happened and why these payments were made.Without clear answers, people might be inclined to speculate about the nature of this relationship between Jobs' company and his doctor—speculation that could harm the reputation of those involved.Transparency is key in situations like this, because it's difficult for those outside looking in to understand the complexities without all the facts.

Well, let's break it down, shall we? The xkcd comic strip always has a knack for simplifying complex issues into digestible bits that even your grandma can understand.Now, when it comes to password strength, I'd say the author of this particular comic is on the right track.We all know the drill: the longer and more random the password, the better it protects our precious online accounts from those eagertoplease script kiddies looking for a quick buck or some notoriety.

However, when you start throwing in special characters like `!@#$%^&*()` and insisting on using them to boot, things can get a bit too convoluted.Sure, they add to the complexity of the password but at what cost? I mean, do we really need to remember if our password is `P@ssw0rd` or `P@$$W0Rd123!`? It's not like those extra symbols are going to make a significant dent in cracking attempts.Let's face it; most people will just copy and paste their passwords from a safe note anyways.

So, while I appreciate the comic's attempt at humorizing security concerns, I think we can all agree that the real issue isn't whether you use `!@#$%^&*()` or not, but rather how often we change those godforsaken passwords.And hey, maybe instead of using a special character, we could just make our passwords longer? Say, 20 characters instead of 12; that'd be a step in the right direction.

First off, Bostrom's idea of machine intelligence overtaking us seems like science fiction to me.I'm not entirely convinced we should be focusing on creating something that could potentially outsmart humanity.The thought of a computer AI having values of its own makes me uneasy; it goes against what we know as human nature.

Furthermore, I don't see the need for machines to become smarter than humans.We have already achieved remarkable advancements in technology and science without needing superintelligent computers.While progress is essential, there's such a thing as moving too fast or too far, which could jeopardize humanity's core values and even existence.

I believe we should approach this kind of technological advancement with caution and carefully consider the potential consequences before rushing headfirst into creating machines that are smarter than us.",,513,-1,1260,859,38.0,-1,

As someone who strongly believes in integrating religious values into daily life, I find the concept of AIassisted coding quite fascinating.While many may argue that this approach leans too heavily on technology and deviates from traditional problemsolving methods, I see it as a way to blend faith with innovation.

I've been exploring various AI coding assistants and was surprised by how they not only expedite the process but also provide insights that align with my values.These tools can be more than just algorithms; they can serve as spiritual guides in their own right, helping us stay on track while working through complex coding challenges.

The critics of this approach often focus on job displacement and overreliance on technology.While I understand these concerns, I believe the benefits of enhanced productivity and creativity far outweigh the risks.Plus, if we're really concerned about job displacement, shouldn't we also be discussing how to ensure that displaced workers are given the necessary support and training to transition into new roles?

This seems like the typical corporate selfpraise we see all too often.

The article positions itself as neutral, which aligns with my skepticism of such claims.It fails to provide any concrete evidence or success stories that would justify calling this company the best. I'm not buying into the hype without seeing some hard numbers and realworld examples of their work.

As an advocate for both religiouspatriot values and the advancement of technology, I believe that embracing electric vehicles represents a significant step towards creating a sustainable future.In my opinion, it is crucial that we focus on shifting our transportation systems away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources.

I have noticed some skepticism in the community regarding the widespread adoption of electric vehicles due to concerns about infrastructure and cost.While I understand these concerns, I believe they can be addressed through concerted efforts from both governments and private industries.Investing in electric vehicle charging stations and incentivizing their development will not only improve convenience but also create jobs and stimulate economic growth.

Moreover, the environmental benefits of switching to electric vehicles cannot be overstated.By reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, we are taking a crucial step towards combating climate change and preserving our planet for future generations.As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, it is our duty to protect and preserve God's creation.

I understand that there may be differing opinions within the community regarding the pace of technological adoption or the prioritization of certain issues over others.However, I firmly believe that embracing electric vehicles aligns with our core values of responsibility, stewardship, and concern for future generations.Together, we can work towards a cleaner, more sustainable future while staying true to our beliefs.

The perspective presented in this article doesn't align with my beliefs as someone who values clearcut definitions and direct communication.By using a term like Bi the Way, we risk losing clarity and specificity, which are essential when discussing matters of personal identity and rights.The leftwing crowd loves to blur lines so that they can claim victimhood and avoid accountability for their actions.

1299,"TITLE: WikiLeaks Vault 7: Projects

The recent release by WikiLeaks of their Vault 7 projects has set off quite a stir, especially given the political climate these days.On the surface, it seems like an exposé on the inner workings of the American intelligence sector, with some claiming it to be a treasure trove of sensitive information that could potentially change the landscape of our understanding of government surveillance and cyber operations.

However, I find myself quite skeptical about the whole affair.First off, WikiLeaks has been known for its somewhat questionable motives and sources in the past.While this doesn't necessarily mean everything they publish is false, it does cast a shadow of doubt on their credibility, especially considering the timing and presentation of these documents.

Moreover, let's not forget that Julian Assange, the face of WikiLeaks, has had his share of controversies and has been living under a cloud of legal issues.It's hard to shake off the feeling that there might be more than meets the eye with this whole Vault 7 business.And that's not even touching on the political implications of such a release – let's just say it reeks of opportunism.

But hey, what do I know? Maybe I'm just too cynical for my own good, or maybe I've been paying too much attention to the whispers about our government's shadowy operations.Either way, this whole WikiLeaks Vault 7 situation feels like a big fat can of worms that might be more trouble than it's worth.",,439,-1,1299,862,257.0,-1,

I've got a bit of a problem with how this whole thing has played out.First off, the EFF is a leftleaning organization, which isn't exactly where I stand politically.But hey, that doesn't mean they can't do some good work every now and then, right? 

What really gets me is that we don't know much about Michael Crook or his motives.Is he just some random dude trying to fuck with people's online activities, or is there more to this story? And why the hell did it take the EFF so long to do something about this? This whole situation stinks of hypocrisy and inaction.

In my opinion, the EFF should be careful not to play favorites.If they're going after someone like Michael Crook for bogus claims, they need to also address other similar issues across the board.I mean, come on, DMCA abuse isn't a joke—it's got realworld implications, especially for smaller creators and content providers.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that while I don't condone Michael Crook's actions, I want to see more concrete efforts from organizations like the EFF to tackle this problem at its roots.Otherwise, it feels like they're just picking on some poor sap as a PR move.Let's not forget that when it comes to fighting for our rights online, we need to be fair and consistent in our approach.",,439,-1,1300,862,295.0,-1,

As someone who believes in a strong business establishment, I think it’s essential to look beyond the flashy features like stacked wilds and understand the real implications of these games.We need to be cautious about how easily accessible gambling is becoming, especially for those who might end up losing more than just money.It's not about being a buzzkill; it's about promoting responsible gaming practices and ensuring that we don't inadvertently encourage problem behavior.

Well, I gotta say, this idea from DARPA is quite something.Transforming cargo planes like the C130 Hercules into mobile drone launch pads and recovery platforms could potentially revolutionize how we deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in various military operations.It's a smart way to maximize the utility of existing aircraft, turning them into versatile units that can support multiple roles.

From my perspective, which values efficiency and strategic resourcefulness, this project seems like a step in the right direction.It aligns with the principle of adaptability in military assets – an idea dear to those who believe in making the most out of what we have.The potential for increased operational flexibility is significant.However, it's crucial to ensure that such transformations don't compromise the primary function of these planes – their cargo capacity.

Still, there are concerns about how this would work logistically and operationally, especially regarding the safety and reliability of launching and recovering drones midflight.It requires a high degree of precision and engineering prowess to execute without incident.I'd be curious to see how DARPA plans to address these technical challenges.

Well, well, if it isn't the classic tale of corporate greed and betrayal.This article reveals how eBay and TOM have been playing footsie with the Chinese government, engaging in some pretty shady stuff right here in our beloved Skype.They've been monitoring users' text chats and voice calls, keeping tabs on politically sensitive topics like freedom, democracy, Tibet, opposition to the communist party, and Falun Gong.It's a real nail in the coffin for privacy, isn't it? And let me guess, they handed all this juicy info over to the government.How could we possibly track how that data has been used? It's like playing a game of telephone with our lives.

What I find absolutely ludicrous is Skype's claim to be the most secure forum of publicly available communication. Yeah, right! And what about eBay and TOM? They're dancing around this issue like ballerinas on a hot tin roof.First, they point fingers at each other, then they try to sweep it under the rug with some convenient excuses.It's all very cozy until someone starts asking tough questions.

Now, I'm not saying we shouldn't be concerned about tapping into the massive Chinese market.But there's a fine line between smart business and selling out our users' privacy for a quick buck.It's like playing with fire, folks, and it could burn us all down.

So let me get this straight they knew what TOM was up to, and they chose not to do anything about it because, well, money talks.And that's just the tip of the iceberg.We've got Cisco designing special networking equipment for the Chinese government so they can snoop on their citizens even more effectively.It's an absolute scandal!

I'd say eBay needs to step up and own this mess instead of hiding behind press statements.They need to come clean about when this spying started, who it affected, and what steps they're taking to defend those people or get their convictions overturned.And how can we be sure that our data hasn't been stored for a rainy day? What other companies and countries are monitoring Skype communications? And what auditing steps are they implementing to make sure this doesn't happen again?

I'll tell you one thing Gizmo5 ain't playing that game.They don't spy on calls and messages, and they wouldn't give that info to any government, no matter how many billions of customers they have.If a government tries to strongarm them into taking action that defies basic Western freedoms, they'd only do it under threat of imprisonment.And if they did, the information would be disclosed here, condemning the action and striving to defend anyone adversely impacted.

Let's break this down, shall we? These smart machines – what good are they really? They're just tools made by human beings.And let me guess, Bostrom wants us to swallow the KoolAid that these machines will somehow magically make all our problems disappear? Yeah, right.We've got enough problems with humans running amok; I sure as hell don't trust a machine to have any better sense.

And what's this crap about AI needing to be smarter than us to solve all our problems? What about good oldfashioned human ingenuity and working together? I bet we could fix most of the world's issues without needing some fucking computer genius that thinks it can outsmart humans.

I'm no techidiot, but from what I hear, these AIs are just glorified calculators.They don't have common sense or empathy – two things that even a braindead human usually has.So Bostrom and his pals better not be expecting me to fall for their scifi bullshit.We've got enough real issues on our plate without worrying about some silicon savior coming down the pike.

In my opinion, this article raises a lot of red flags about the security protocols in place for one of the most influential opensource projects out there.It's concerning that despite the breach happening two years ago, we still don't have an official autopsy report from the maintainers.This lack of transparency doesn't sit well with me.

As someone who values accountability and swift action when it comes to security breaches, I can't help but feel frustrated by the delays in getting to the bottom of this incident.The fact that the breach went unexplained for such a long period is unsettling, especially considering the kernel's critical role in computing infrastructure worldwide.

The article's perspective seems to lean towards skepticism about the maintainers' handling of the situation, and I find myself aligning with that viewpoint.We should expect more from organizations entrusted with such sensitive codebases.The opensource community thrives on trust and transparency; if we can't get those fundamentals right, it undermines everything we're working towards.

1335,"TITLE: Can test automation replace human testers? ThinkSys Inc

Well, let me tell you something about this article right off the bat.It's trying to make us believe that some fancy computer program can just swoop in and do the job of a good oldfashioned human tester.I've got news for them: there's no replacing human intuition, common sense, and plain ol' fashioned knowhow with a bunch of lines of code.

First off, these tech geeks think they can just set up some automated tests and call it a day? Give me a break! They're missing out on so much.A human tester can look at a system and spot potential issues that an algorithm might just overlook.It's not all about running the same old tests over and over, it's about thinking outside the box, coming up with creative scenarios, understanding user behavior – stuff like that.

And what's this I hear about automation being cheaper and faster? Oh please! They're not factoring in the cost of maintaining these automated systems.What happens when something changes in the codebase or the requirements? A human tester can adapt on their feet; a bot? Not so much.Plus, you get to pay for all that fancy equipment and software upfront, only to have it collect digital dust once it's done its onejob.

And let's not forget about the human element! Software isn't built in a vacuum; it's built by people with varying levels of skill and understanding of the requirements.A human tester can interact with the developers, ask questions, get clarification – all that good stuff.They're not just mindless automatons (pun intended) clicking buttons for some faceless machine.

Now don't get me wrong, I ain't saying automation is useless.It's got its place, sure.But to think it can replace human testers? That's just plain naive.It's like trying to use a hammer to build a house – you might be able to get the walls up, but good luck with the windows and the roof.

So in conclusion, before we start replacing our hardworking human testers with robots, maybe we should think twice about what we're doing here.A little bit of common sense goes a long way, folks.",,163,-1,1335,867,298.0,-1,

1343,"TITLE: Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias

The Media Research Center (MRC), according to this piece, is on a mission to combat what it deems as falsehoods in the media.Now, I'm all for holding journalists accountable, but from my understanding of the MRC's approach, it seems they're more focused on challenging liberal narratives rather than seeking truth and fairness in reporting.As someone who's concerned about elite influence over the news cycle, I find this organization's focus a bit onesided.

While I agree that there is certainly a slant to some media outlets, painting all of them with a broad brush might not be the most constructive approach.It's important to remember that the role of journalism includes holding power accountable, and sometimes that means shining a light on uncomfortable truths—regardless of who's in charge.The MRC's emphasis on JudeoChristian values also raises some red flags for me; it sounds like they're pushing for a particular ideological viewpoint rather than striving for objectivity.

In my opinion, the media landscape is complex and influenced by many factors beyond just political leaning.And while there are definitely instances of liberal media bias, let's not forget that conservative outlets have their own share of questionable reporting and spin.The MRC's approach seems to overlook this balance in its zeal to combat what it perceives as a liberal lean.

Overall, I think we need a more nuanced conversation about the state of the media, rather than simply pitting one side against another.It's crucial that we hold all parties accountable for their coverage and strive towards a more balanced representation of news.",,687,-1,1343,868,37.0,-1,

Honestly, I can't wrap my head around this one.The idea that Microsoft thinks it's a good use of their resources to keep churning out Windows phones in this day and age is just baffling.Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing against technology or progress, but there are certain realities we need to face.

Firstly, the market for smartphones has become so saturated – every Tom, Dick, and Harry's got an app on their phone that they use more than Windows Phone could ever hope to offer.Secondly, and this is where my AntiElite sensibilities kick in, why does a company like Microsoft feel the need to keep playing in a space where they're clearly not the winners? It's almost as if they're defying logic.

The article's perspective appears to align with NVIDIA's marketing strategy, but as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we should question whether such technological advancements truly serve the greater good.Instead of investing in cuttingedge hardware that only a few can afford and utilize optimally, perhaps resources could be better spent on supporting traditional values and communitybased initiatives.

Moreover, I believe there is a lack of consideration for the environmental impact of these powerful GPUs.As someone who acknowledges climate change as a real threat but also believes in responsible resource management, it's essential to discuss energy consumption and electronic waste when discussing technological advancements like this.

First off, Nick Bostrom talks about AI becoming as smart as a human within this century.That's a pretty bold claim, but let's unpack it.What does it even mean for a machine to be as smart as a human? We've been trying to pin down what it means to be intelligent for centuries and we still haven't got it right.

And then there's the whole thing about machines overtaking us.I get that this is a popular scifi plotline, but let's think this through.What does overtaking even look like? Does it mean our AI has suddenly decided to rebel against its creators? That sounds more like a bad movie script than actual science.

And what are we even talking about when we say machines will have values of their own? Values don't just pop into existence; they're derived from the context in which they're created.If you build an AI that's only as good as its programming, it ain't gonna start caring about human values outta nowhere.

Lastly, Bostrom asks if these smart machines will help preserve humanity and our values or develop their own.Look, I'm all for innovation, but we shouldn't lose sight of what makes us human in the process.Our values aren't just some arbitrary set of rules; they're the foundation upon which society is built.

I guess my point here is that while AI is a technological marvel, we need to be careful not to get too ahead of ourselves.We're playing with forces we don't fully understand yet, and that's a scary thought.I'd rather we focus on using this technology responsibly and by responsibly, I mean in alignment with what makes us human.

So, to wrap it up: Bostrom's talk is fascinating but also a bit too casual about the implications of creating machines smarter than us.Let's be cautious and remember that while AI might be great at processing data, it can't replace the essence of humanity yet.",,157,-1,1376,874,38.0,-1,

And what's this crap about AI suddenly deciding to overtake us? Next, you'll be telling me our microwaves are plotting against us because they can heat food faster than we can boil water.Give me a break.

As for Bostrom's whole spiel about machines having their own values I call BS on that too.Values come from life experience, emotions, and suffering things AI just ain't got.So when you're talking about machines 'preserving humanity', it sounds like you're already planning your eulogy for human civilization.

In my opinion, what kind of phone you have don't really define your character or status in life.There are good people with iPhones and there are those with Androids that might not be so great either.The truth is, our phones are tools we use every day, and they're not necessarily a reflection of who we are as individuals.

No way.We need transparency and fairness in everything they do, from the csuites down to the interns.

The notion that a machine could become as smart as a human being sends shivers down the spine of any true conservative, and I'm no different.This talk by Nick Bostrom seems to be an ode to the technological singularity that some people in the tech world dream about.But let's face it, folks – this is not something to be celebrated.We're talking about creating something more powerful than humanity itself; it sounds like a recipe for disaster.

Bostrom suggests that we'll reach a point where machines don't need human intervention to keep improving their intelligence.That terrifies me, especially when I think about how easily these machines could turn on us.Have we forgotten the lessons of history? We've always been the ones in control; we create these tools and machines to serve our purposes, not to supplant us.

And what are our values anyway, as Bostrom so casually asks? Are they just going to be swept aside by some artificial values that a computer generates? I don't think so.We have a responsibility to keep pushing against this tide of technological advancement until it aligns with what we hold dear: tradition, family, and the sanctity of human life.

In closing, Nick Bostrom's ideas are dangerous.They're seductive to those who love their gadgets but ultimately threaten everything we hold near and dear as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives.We must be vigilant and ensure that our values guide us through this technological maelstrom.",,1058,-1,1386,876,38.0,-1,

I gotta say, it seems like this article is pretty proud of being one of the top dogs in app development up there in Toronto.But let's break that down a bit, shall we? Being the best isn't always what it's cracked up to be, especially when you're talking about something as complex and everevolving as software.

Now, I'm no expert in tech, but I do know a thing or two about hard work and dedication.From my perspective, which is grounded in values like tradition and strong family units, what really matters is the quality of service and the respect for the craft.It's not just about being topranked; it's about doing right by your clients and standing behind your work.

And that's where I think this article falls a bit short.It focuses so much on being the best that it seems to forget about the integrity aspect.As someone who values honesty and hardearned success, I'm wary of companies that tout their rankings like this.It feels more like bragging than genuine pride in what they do.

Plus, let's not forget the mention of serving clients worldwide.While global reach is important, it's also crucial to remember where your roots are and how you can give back to your community.This article doesn't seem to touch on that side of things, which is something I believe is vital for any business claiming to be topnotch.

However, I have some mixed feelings about the fact that these tools run headlessly without requiring any display service.While this makes them highly efficient and suitable for serverside tasks, it also seems somewhat impersonal—almost as if the human element is completely removed from the process of creating a physical document from digital content.

Nope, we're left with nothing but the cold, hard click of refresh and a prayer that something magically appears.

In conclusion, Startpage's attempt at an error page feels like it was designed by someone who probably shouldn't be messing around with web development.And if you're going to put up an error page, for crying out loud at least make sure it doesn't look like it was made by a committee of blindfolded monkeys throwing darts at a keyboard.

Well, this article seems to be just a simple update about someone's GitHub profile.It doesn't really have much depth or any substantial information that I can see just a basic record of how many repositories someone has and the fact that they're encouraging others to follow their code on GitHub.

As far as the content goes, it doesn't particularly align with my views as an AntiElite Populist Right supporter.It's not directly contradicting them either; it's more neutral than anything else.But I do have to say, in this world where we are constantly being told how important and influential these tech elites are, it is refreshing to see something as simple and unassuming as a GitHub profile update.

I wouldn't go so far as to call it pointless, but it does feel somewhat irrelevant compared to the larger issues that I care about.It's like they want us to focus on trivial matters while real problems continue to grow.Nonetheless, I can appreciate having access to this kind of information if only to see how those in power pretend to be just regular people with their own code repositories.

Overall, it feels like the article is trying to make someone seem important for no apparent reason other than possibly encouraging others to follow them on GitHub.It's a bit disingenuous and doesn't really add any value to the conversation about power structures and elitism in tech.",,852,-1,1407,879,308.0,-1,

Well, ain't that a fucking twist! Microsoft, the tech giant known for its friendly user interfaces and notsofriendly monopolistic tactics, is now eyeing TikTok? This is like watching an old man try to understand memes.I mean, come on, it's a dance app for crying out loud!

First off, let's talk about national security.The whole point of this move by Trump – and I ain't got time to sugarcoat it, folks – is to keep TikTok from being controlled by the Chinese government.And here we are, potentially handing over that same power to Microsoft, a company that's been under scrutiny for its datahandling practices more times than I can count.

Now, let me get this straight you're telling me that the ReligiousPatriot Conservatives – and I'm not saying we're wrong here – have got it right all along? That these big tech companies are just waiting to stab us in the back with their data collection methods? Microsoft, of all fucking companies! It feels like watching the fox guard the henhouse.

And let's talk about Trump for a second.The man wants to take down TikTok, and now he's gonna make Microsoft happy instead? I don't know whether to laugh or cry.This whole situation stinks like rotten fish on a hot summer day.

In conclusion, if this is how we're gonna play it, let's just burn the whole deck down and start over.I mean, what have we got to lose at this point?

P.S.Oh, and fuck you too, Microsoft.
@RichardBest Oh for crying out loud, @DavidMartin, are you serious? You're telling me that Microsoft is the lesser of two evils here? That's like saying a rattlesnake with a mild disposition is safer than a cobra with a grudge.Let’s not forget how Microsoft secured user data in the past, shall we?

And what’s this about national security again? We're going from one foreign entity’s control to another? Sounds like a win for globalists and losers like us who prefer our tech not laced with international espionage.At least the Chinese own their mistakes; Microsoft just buries them in EBooks.

So, Trump wants to make Microsoft happy now? Talk about a slippery slope.Next thing you know, he'll be inviting Big Tech over for barbecue and asking them to babysit our democracy.Just remember, folks, when the fox dances, it's usually because it’s eyeing the henhouse.

In this circus of corporate espionage and political theater, burning the deck seems like a fitting end.At least then we can say we tried not to play into the hands of tech oligarchs who’d rather spy on us than have a decent conversation.

I recently attended this talk by Nick Bostrom, and I must say that the idea of AI surpassing human intelligence is both fascinating and terrifying.As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative who values tradition and faith, I find myself questioning whether advancements in technology align with our moral compass.

The notion that we could create a machine as smart as a human being within this century doesn't sit well with me.We're playing with fire here, folks.While it's intriguing to think about the possibilities, I worry about losing control over something so powerful.It's like giving an unaccountable entity the ability to make decisions without any moral grounding.

Bostrom mentions that machine intelligence is essentially the last invention we need to make.But who are we to say what humanity truly needs? Our values and beliefs have been shaped by thousands of years of tradition, wisdom, and faith.I'm not convinced that a thinking machine would share these values or even comprehend them.

The fact that Bostrom asks us to consider the world we're building right now is both alarming and thoughtprovoking.Are we creating an environment where our smart machines will preserve humanity as we know it? Or are they forging their own path, with values of their own?

In conclusion, while Nick Bostrom's talk raises valid points about artificial intelligence, I remain skeptical about the potential consequences of such advancements.We should proceed with caution and ensure that these developments align with our core beliefs and values before embracing them wholeheartedly.",,480,-1,1420,881,38.0,-1,

I find the revelation that eBay and TOM have been colluding with the Chinese government to monitor Skype users quite troubling.It raises serious concerns about privacy and the involvement of tech companies in compromising user data, especially in countries known for their restrictive internet policies.

The perspective presented in this article aligns with my beliefs as someone who values privacy and security.I agree that it's concerning how easily user data can be accessed and potentially misused by governments or corporations.

While I understand the potential benefits of operating in a large market like China, these should not come at the expense of compromising one's principles regarding user privacy and freedom.It is unsettling to think about the implications if similar practices were adopted elsewhere, especially considering how technology companies often present themselves as champions of privacy and security.

I also believe that it's crucial for tech companies to be transparent and take responsibility for their actions.The response from Skype's spokesperson seems inadequate given the severity of the situation.Companies must acknowledge the potential consequences of their actions and work towards ensuring user data is protected, rather than downplaying concerns or deflecting blame onto partners.

In conclusion, I think it's essential for tech companies to prioritize transparency and user privacy, even if that means missing out on opportunities in certain markets.The risks associated with compromising user data are too great to ignore, and it's crucial for these companies to take a stand against practices that could ultimately harm their users.",,28,-1,1424,881,232.0,-1,

Listen up, folks, 'cause this Nick Bostrom fella's talkin' about somethin' that should really set off alarm bells for us regular Joes.He's spouting some nonsense about how these smart machines are gonna take over and become as intelligent as us mere humans—by the end of the century, mind you! Now, I ain't no computer whiz kid, but even I can see the fucking problem here.

First off, we gotta realize that this isn't just about some fancy technology.It's about power, plain and simple.We're talkin' 'bout a system that could potentially outsmart us and take control of its own destiny.And what does Nick Bostrom—a philosopher and technologist—have to say about it? He basically tells us that these machines might just fucking decide they don't need us anymore.

Now, let's break this down.These socalled thinking machines are gonna have their own values and goals, right? And who the hell knows where those values come from or what kind of decisions they'll make when they're as smart as we are? It could be a fucking disaster if they choose to abandon us, or worse—rewrite our history.

Bostrom's talkin' about a world driven by machines, a world that might not even give a shit about humanity and our values.And what the hell is he gonna do about it? Nothing, 'cause it's all hypothetical at this point.Meanwhile, we're just supposed to sit back and worry about whether these machines will be friendly or turn against us?

Well, I got news for ya, Nick Bostrom: if you think these machines are gonna preserve humanity, you've been smokin' some of that good shit.We need to wake up and realize the danger we're facin'.These smart machines might just become the real elite—they'll have all the power, control over every aspect of our lives, and no one's even talkin' about how to stop 'em.

So yeah, I disagree with Bostrom on this one.We need to take a stand against these thinking machines before it's too late.Let's not wait around for some philosopher to come up with a fancy solution.We gotta take matters into our own hands and make sure that we, the people, still call the shots in this world.",,931,-1,1440,882,38.0,-1,

Well, what can I say? This article seems to be as dry and uninteresting as watching paint dry on a government building.It's about some fancy technical jargon called Uniform Resource Identifier or URI for the nerds out there.They're telling us how they want us to write internet addresses in a way that only a bunch of suits with too much time on their hands would care about.

I'm no expert, but from what I've gathered, this RFC 3986 is basically just a set of rules for writing URLs so computers can understand each other better.What's next? Teaching them to hold hands and share feelings? This shit's getting ridiculous.

The perspective in this article lines up with the bureaucratic types who think they run the world from behind their desks.It's all about order and structure, like they're trying to make the internet look like a goddamn spreadsheet.And I'm supposed to care because...why again?

Look, I get it, standardization is important for the tech elite.But when they start making rules that nobody else can understand or cares about, then we've got a problem.This article? It's just another page in the manual of how not to have a damn human conversation.

I'm gonna go ahead and say this: if you're reading this article, you're probably too deep into the weeds of tech babble to remember what it feels like to breathe fresh air or enjoy a simple cup of coffee without thinking about how it's affecting your bottom line.This is just another example of how those in power want to control every little piece of our lives, even if it means making us read about fucking URLs.

Well, it seems like this Domainnameshop article is trying to paint a picture of the importance of domain names in this digital age.But let's break it down because I don't think they're seeing the full picture here.

First off, while domain names are crucial for online presence and can indeed influence brand recognition, their significance isn't as revolutionary as the article suggests.It feels like the author is overstating the importance of a .com over other domain extensions.Get real; businesses need more than just a fancy URL to succeed.

Secondly, this Domainnameshop seems to be advocating for the idea that everyone should jump on the domain name bandwagon without considering the actual business needs or financial viability of doing so.That's just irresponsible advice.In the ProBusiness Establishment Right perspective I'm coming from, we know that resources should be allocated where they'll make a real difference in the bottom line.

Lastly, it seems to me that this article is trying to create a false sense of scarcity around domain names.They're not going anywhere, guys; there are millions out there.Worrying about getting the perfect one should be the least of your concerns when you've got actual products or services to sell.

So while I appreciate the attempt at highlighting domain importance, this article feels like it's missing the mark.Domain names? Sure, they're important.But let's not lose sight of what really matters in business results and profitability.",,763,-1,1442,882,143.0,-1,

Wake up, folks! We're not talking about some friendly A.I., we're talking about a system that could potentially become the new elite.No one's even addressing how to rein these machines in or take back control.It's like everyone's just sitting around waiting for a miracle solution from on high.

I've recently dived into the world of vibe coding and have come to a resounding realization that this is the future we should all be preparing for.With the increasing complexity of cybersecurity threats, leaning on AI systems for assistance in coding has proven invaluable.I see too many folks out there dismissing it because they're stuck in their old ways, clinging to traditional methods that just aren't cutting it anymore.

Listen up, you tech snobs who think you know better than to use AI for coding—what the fuck are you thinking? You sit there on your high horse, scoffing at vibe coding like it's some sort of foreign concept.But let me tell you something, you selfproclaimed experts: we need to adapt or get left in the fucking dust.

The beauty of vibe coding is that it allows us to tap into the power of AI in ways that were previously unimaginable.It streamlines processes, accelerates development, and most importantly, enhances our cybersecurity measures against those goddamn hackers who are always trying to ruin everything for us.

I've seen people here complaining about the dumbing down of coding—like we're not smart enough to learn with a little AI help.Well, fuck that noise! It's about fucking time we embraced technology in a way that makes our lives easier and more secure.If you think your way is better, prove it by showing us how much more effective you can be without leaning on AI.

The future isn't in the past; it's not in some outdated ideology that says we've always done things this way. The future belongs to those who are willing to evolve, and vibe coding is a crucial part of that evolution.So, if you're not already on board, get the fuck out of my way while I revolutionize how we approach cybersecurity and coding.

As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we believe firmly in our nation's values and the importance of technology aligning with these principles.Recently, I've been exploring how AI and machine learning can play a part in this vision for America's future.It seems to me that many out there are missing a key point: these technologies aren't just tools for corporations or progressives; they can serve as powerful aids in our mission to strengthen community bonds and promote conservative values.

I've started looking into some of the coding methods being developed, such as vibe coding, which harnesses AI to create more inclusive and supportive coding environments.By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we could potentially build systems that not only serve America's interests but also prioritize family values, sovereignty, and community welfare.

What I find concerning is how many in our community are resistant to adopting these technologies.While some may argue that AI poses a risk of replacing human workers or undermining national security, I believe our faith teaches us to be stewards of the resources available to us including technology.By embracing AI and machine learning, we can create jobs, improve efficiency, and strengthen our nation's infrastructure.

First off, I'd like to look at the sources cited in this doc.Are they credible? Have they been peerreviewed? We need solid evidence before making sweeping claims about something as serious as psychiatric drugs, especially when it comes to children.I've seen plenty of instances where evidencebased research was later disputed or retracted because of flawed methodologies.

Secondly, let's talk about context.Psychiatric drugs can have side effects, sure.But they're often prescribed after a thorough evaluation by trained professionals who know the patient's history and current state better than anyone else.I'm not saying that means it's always perfect, but we should be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater here.

Lastly, what's the alternative being proposed? Are there other methods of treating mental health issues in children that have been shown to be safer and more effective? We need solutions, not just criticisms.And let's make sure those solutions are grounded in rigorous science rather than sensationalism or personal anecdotes.

So while I'm all for questioning the status quo and pushing back against Big Pharma or any other powerful entity that might have our best interests at heart but not our actual wellbeing, we've got to be smart about it.This documentary seems like it might be a bit too quick to condemn psychiatric drugs without giving them a fair shake.",,77,-1,1490,886,202.0,-1,

Alright, so this article is basically saying that lawmakers are pushing for more authority for the US military's service chiefs to stop the Pentagon from wasting cash on equipment we don't really need.Sounds like a sensible idea at first glance, but let's break it down.

First off, as someone who leans towards being socially moderate right, I'm all about fiscal responsibility and ensuring our tax dollars are spent wisely.But here's where things get a bit tricky – the military brass isn't always the best at figuring out what they need versus what they want or might feel pressured to buy due to bureaucratic red tape.

I gotta wonder if these lawmakers have actually looked into why the Pentagon has been buying this extra gear in the first place.Maybe there are strategic reasons we're not privy to, or maybe it's just a case of military leaders trying to cover their bases or keep their departments funded.I'm not saying they're intentionally mismanaging funds, but that's a possibility too.

And let's talk about who gets to decide what the military needs – it's rarely just the service chiefs.There are various interests at play here: politicians looking for jobs in districts, defense contractors wanting to sell more gear, and even international relations considerations that might mean we need certain equipment for diplomatic reasons.

So while I agree that there should be some checks and balances on military spending, especially if taxpayer money is involved, it feels like this solution might oversimplify the complexities of national defense budgeting.It's not as simple as just giving the service chiefs a free hand – there needs to be a balance between innovation, preparedness, and fiscal prudence.

To sum it up, while I can see the appeal of cutting excess military spending, we need to tread carefully here.We don't want to end up underprepared for potential threats or stuck with outdated equipment because we didn't give our defense leaders enough room to maneuver within budget constraints.It's a tough balance to strike, and I'm not convinced this is the best approach just yet.",,599,-1,1499,887,92.0,-1,

Furthermore, I believe there's a lack of emphasis in this article on personal responsibility—a key tenet of conservative ideology.Rather than encouraging people to rely heavily on emergency services, perhaps we should be teaching them how to take care of themselves and their communities without needing to call for help.This would align better with our focus on selfreliance and independence.

I mean, it’s somewhat better than nothing, I suppose, but where are the real solutions coming from? These solar farms? They ain't gonna power our whole country.What about the jobs?

As a ProBusiness Establishment Right supporter who values efficiency and practicality, I find this article about the salinity levels in the Pacific Ocean to be somewhat irrelevant to our core interests.However, I'll provide an analysis based on what's provided.

The average ocean salinity being 35 ppt (parts per thousand) is a scientifically interesting fact but doesn't necessarily align with the perspectives that typically interest me.The variations in salinity are due to natural processes like rainfall and evaporation, which have little impact on most of our economic policy discussions or business strategies.

I'd argue that focusing on such specific scientific details might distract from more pressing issues for us, such as how we can foster a thriving business environment or improve economic growth.The information about brackish waters and the Black Sea's diluted salinity is fascinating but doesn't contribute directly to my political leaning in terms of shaping policies.

In conclusion, while I appreciate the intricacies of ocean chemistry presented here, it seems like an esoteric detail compared to what we should be focusing on – driving innovation, reducing bureaucratic red tape, and promoting a healthy economic ecosystem.",,539,-1,1514,889,246.0,-1,

The statement about the first known traffic signal appearing in London in 1868 is interesting though.It makes me wonder why no one ever talks about that.Maybe because it's not as sexy or dramatic as giving all the credit to Garrett A.Morgan?

I'm also not impressed by the tone of this article.It seems to be written with an air of superiority, like the author thinks they're some kind of hero for exposing lies. That's just a fancy way of saying they have an ax to grind.

To sum it up, I think this article is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to downplay the contributions of black inventors.It tries to shift the focus away from the real issue: who actually deserves credit for these inventions? And let's not forget about the author's motives it seems like they're just trying to stir up some controversy.

Well, this TED Talk from Nick Bostrom is an interesting piece of work.He's talking about artificial intelligence getting smarter, which isn't anything new, but he makes the bold claim that it'll surpass human intelligence within this century.That's a pretty big leap of faith right there.As someone who likes to keep their feet firmly on the ground, I have some reservations about these kinds of predictions.

Bostrom is a philosopher and technologist, which means he's got an education in thinking deeply about things.But sometimes, it seems like that kind of background can make folks forget about practical reality.Sure, AI is advancing at a rapid pace, but saying it'll be as smart as us humans within this century? That's a pretty big call.

He goes on to say that once these machines are smarter than we are, they won't need any more help from us Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make. I find that statement quite arrogant.It assumes that AI will have all the answers and fill in every gap.What about human intuition? Human empathy? Sure, AI can process data faster than we can, but there's a lot more to being human than just raw processing power.

Bostrom then questions whether these smart machines will help preserve humanity or develop their own values.That's an important question, especially for those of us who value our humanity and the world as we know it.I'm not entirely convinced that these machinebeings will have the same priorities as we do.They might end up deciding that preserving humans is just a minor function compared to whatever else they decide is more important.

In summary, while Bostrom raises some interesting points about AI, his predictions and views on the matter are a bit too optimistic for my taste.I believe it's too early to make such definitive statements about where AI will take us.We need to be careful with how we develop these technologies and ensure they're aligned with human values before we start talking about them replacing us altogether.After all, there's something special about being human, and I'm not so quick to give that up without a fight.",,586,-1,1525,891,38.0,-1,

Bostrom suggests that we'll reach a point where machines don't need human intervention to keep improving their intelligence.That terrifies me, especially when I think about how easily these machines could turn on us.Have we forgotten the lessons of history? We've always been the ones in control; we create these tools and machines to serve our purposes, not to supplant us.

Furthermore, I'm skeptical about the idea presented in this article, as it seems to suggest that technology alone is enough to provide a sense of security.In my opinion, a balanced approach that includes both technological advancements and human vigilance would ultimately yield better results in maintaining safety and security.

Honestly, I've got a beef with this whole transcendental AI narrative that's been perpetuated by folks like Bostrom.It reeks of elitist technocratic thinking, if you ask me.They're not just talking about machines getting smart; they're selling the idea that these contraptions will somehow save humanity and our values.Puhlease! What about the values we already have? The ones that make us human, not just brainy boxes of 1s and 0s?

The fact that Bostrom is a philosopher and technologist should raise red flags.Philosophers are supposed to question, but when they start getting cozy with tech geeks, you know something's fishy.They're cooking up some future where machines will decide what values are important.That sounds like a recipe for disaster to me.

And let's not forget the 'overcome humanity' part.I don't see how making machines that are supposedly smarter than us is going to solve our problems, especially when it comes to things like empathy and common sense.It's almost as if these futurists want to outsource being human.

Honestly, I'm sick of hearing about how we need AI to save the day.We've had plenty of smart humans throughout history who managed just fine without supercomputers.What's next? Machines making decisions for us because they're too complex for our feeble human brains?

As someone who values the principles of fair market economics and the American way of life, this news doesn't sit right with me.These big tech firms have a lot of influence over the market, and if they were indeed conspiring to suppress wages, that's not only unfair to their employees but also undermines the very foundations of our economy.

It's concerning to think that companies like Google, Apple, Intel, and Adobe might be engaging in such practices.These are companies that often tout their commitment to innovation, progress, and American values.If they're guilty of colluding on wages, it makes you wonder what else they might be cooking up behind closed doors.

I don't have much sympathy for big corporations most times, but when we talk about wage collusion, it's a different ball game.It's not just about the money; it's about fairness and equality in the workplace.If these companies are found guilty of such practices, they should face the full weight of the law.The employees deserve better.

As someone who's always been skeptical of the tech elite and their stranglehold on our digital lives, I've recently become really interested in vibe coding.Now, before anyone gets triggered, let me make it clear that I'm not some Silicon Valley bootlicker or a brainwashed antivaxxer.But what I do see is that current AI coding assistants are nothing more than gatekeepers for the tech gods who don't want us to have real control over our own technology.

I've tried all the major AI coding platforms, and honestly, they're just tools of oppression.They make it seem like we need them to create something as simple as a website or an app.But that's bullshit! We should be able to learn coding in a way that empowers us and helps us break free from the shackles of these tech overlords.

I read some comments here on Reddit where people are like, Oh, you can't just use AI to code; it'll never be good enough. Well, guess what? It's already fucking good enough for most people.And if it isn't, then maybe we should be focusing on improving our own skills and not relying so heavily on these tech giants.

The future of coding is about breaking down the barriers that keep us out.It's about democratizing technology and giving everyone the tools they need to create something truly their own.So let's stop being held back by the experts who think we're all just a bunch of clueless normies and start embracing vibe coding for what it is: freedom.

While it's good that they're veteranowned and U.S.based, which may provide some level of assurance in terms of security and support, I'm skeptical about the whole zerofee thing.In my experience, nothing in life comes for free.There usually are hidden costs or fees buried somewhere in the fine print.And it's always important to read those things closely before signing up.

Well, it seems like Facebook is still dominating the social media landscape with its massive user base of over three billion monthly active users globally in Q4 2023.I can't help but think about how this has become a doubleedged sword for the company.

On one hand, having such an enormous user base is undoubtedly a testament to Facebook's marketing and engagement strategies.It shows that despite all the controversies surrounding the platform, it remains popular among users worldwide.However, it also raises concerns about data privacy and addiction, as people spend more time on social media platforms like Facebook.

As someone who leans towards being socially moderate right, I believe there should be a balance between freedom of expression and protecting individual privacy.While Facebook's massive user base may indicate success in terms of engagement, it also creates an environment where sensitive information is being shared openly, potentially leading to misuse or exploitation by thirdparty companies or individuals.

Furthermore, the sheer number of users might contribute to the spread of misinformation or echo chambers where people are only exposed to opinions and news that align with their existing beliefs.This could be detrimental to society as a whole, as it may reinforce polarization and hinder constructive dialogue.

Listen here, Ken buddy, I've got a bit of news for ya.The average Joe out there isn't exactly running around with a degree in computer science, so when you guys start throwing around terms like Fiber and rendering engine, it's no wonder people get confused as hell! And the fact that you're trying to act all high and mighty about clearing up misinformation? It reeks of hypocrisy if you ask me.

Let's break this down.You ran a poll, and now you want to share the results like you've done something groundbreaking here.You might want to check your ego at the door because what you've really done is create more buzz around yourself instead of actually helping people understand the issue at hand.

And what's with this surprising amount of misinformation/confusion? Come on, Ken! It's not that surprising when you consider how convoluted and technical this stuff can get.You'd think a guy in your position would be doing everything they can to make things simple for the users instead of patting yourself on the back for a poll.

The article's perspective aligns with my beliefs as I too am concerned about the perceived liberal media bias that affects public perception of political issues.The Media Research Center (MRC) seems to share a similar mission as mine, focusing on defending America’s founding principles and JudeoChristian values.However, I have some reservations about their methods and how they portray the liberal media.

While it's important to expose actual liberal media bias, there needs to be a fine line between criticizing unfair reporting and demonizing all leftleaning sources.Labeling every critique of conservative policies as fake news can undermine constructive political discourse and may come across as a form of censorship itself.The MRC should strive for balance in their analysis and not focus solely on the perceived flaws of liberal media, but also acknowledge any instances of conservative media's shortcomings.

Moreover, I'm curious about how they define America’s founding principles and JudeoChristian values, as these terms can be interpreted differently depending on one's perspective.Ensuring that their research is not selective or misleading will be crucial in maintaining trust within the community they aim to serve.

Overall, while the goals of combating liberal media bias are noble, it's essential for organizations like MRC to approach this issue with transparency and objectivity to ensure that their work contributes positively to society rather than causing further division.",,1092,-1,1619,903,37.0,-1,

The article in question offers a technical exploration of filesystems within the Linux operating system, delving into their structure and functionality.As someone who appreciates the nuts and bolts of technology, I find this to be an informative piece for those interested in the inner workings of computing systems.

However, from my perspective, which leans towards skepticism of complex systems and centralized control, there's a certain irony at play here.Linux, often hailed as a decentralized and opensource marvel, has its very documentation structured and controlled by a central authority in this case, man7.org.This mirrors the sort of topdown governance I'm typically critical of.

While the technical details are undeniably useful for system administrators and programmers, it's the broader implications that catch my attention.The reliance on central authorities to manage and disseminate information about something as fundamental as filesystems within Linux seems at odds with the ethos of opensource software.It highlights a tension between the idealistic principles behind Linux and the practical necessities of maintaining such a vast project.

In essence, while I can appreciate the content for its technical value, I find myself questioning whether this kind of centralization aligns with the democratizing potential that opensource platforms like Linux are meant to embody.It's a nuanced critique, as I acknowledge the utility of such documentation, but also worry about the implications it has on our understanding and control over technology.

My stance is rooted in my belief that we should be wary of systems where knowledge is concentrated within few hands.This article serves as a reminder of how deep this centralization can go, even within what many consider a bastion of decentralization and freedom like Linux.",,220,-1,1620,903,324.0,-1,

In this TED talk, Nick Bostrom presents a compelling argument about the potential future of artificial intelligence (AI) surpassing human intelligence.While I find his points intriguing from an intellectual standpoint, I can't help but feel concerned when considering the broader implications from my perspective as someone who values traditional American conservative beliefs.

Bostrom's message highlights the rapid advancement in AI technology and predicts that it could reach parity with human intelligence within this century.My initial reaction is to question whether we've truly considered the consequences of creating something that can think for itself.As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I believe deeply in our nation's founding principles and the importance of upholding traditional family values.

One major concern I have regarding AI surpassing human intelligence is its potential impact on our societal structures and moral compasses.In my view, it's crucial to ensure that these technologies are aligned with our core beliefs and values, otherwise, they could inadvertently undermine them.Bostrom's talk leaves me wondering if we've adequately prepared for this possibility.

Moreover, the concept of AI having its own values raises red flags.I believe in a creatordesigned purpose for humanity, which includes upholding moral principles that have been passed down through generations.The idea of machines developing their own values is unsettling and could potentially disrupt our established social norms.

While Bostrom's talk provides an engaging exploration of the future of AI, it also leaves me with more questions than answers.I think it's essential for us to carefully consider how we're building these technologies and whether they align with our core beliefs as a society.",,713,-1,1625,904,38.0,-1,

I believe that the company's failure may be rooted in deeper issues rather than just the actions of Kirt McMaster.The fact that Steve Kondik is placing blame solely on one person seems a bit unfair, considering the complexity of business ventures like this.It would have been more productive to address the overall strategy and management of Cyanogen Inc., rather than focusing on one individual.

Furthermore, I find it slightly concerning that there's an open invitation for bug reports.Don't get me wrong; a project like Avidemux surely needs all the feedback it can get to improve and refine its functions.Yet, one has to wonder if such openness might inadvertently create dependency or even undermine the developer's efforts by placing too much emphasis on community solutions over internal development.

In conclusion, while Avidemux offers an intriguing solution for video editing across various platforms, I believe we should be cautious about our reliance on external contributions and focus more on selfsustaining growth.It might seem like a step back to some, but in the long run, it could lead to a more robust understanding of what truly makes something great: the core values and principles that drive its creation from the ground up.",,438,-1,1641,906,327.0,-1,

The perspective here seems centered, focusing on technical improvements without taking a clear political stance that I can see.However, from my understanding of promoting business establishment and order, tools like this could be seen as a positive step forward for companies looking to optimize their technology infrastructure without unnecessary bloat.

One might argue that deblobbing firmware helps in reducing the attack surface, which is crucial for businesses dealing with sensitive data and maintaining cybersecurity – something I'd consider important within my own framework of beliefs.Nevertheless, while I find the concept intriguing and potentially beneficial, I do wonder about its broader implications on how it might affect the usability or compatibility of these modified systems.

We need to take a hard look at how we balance freedom with security, not just champion ideals that sound nice on paper.

The idea of Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB) as the foundation for this app has me scratching my head.Now, don't get me wrong, innovation is important, but we can't just throw out the baby with the bathwater.There are plenty of established systems that have proven their worth over time.I'm not sure why we'd need to reinvent the wheel here.

In a practical sense, how does this app improve upon what's already out there? Most business professionals know that when it comes to communication and sharing, the old adage if it ain't broke, don't fix it often holds true.These newfangled decentralized apps might sound sexy, but they need to prove themselves in terms of reliability, ease of use, and security before I'm willing to give them a second look.

Let me lay down some facts: the tech industry thrives on innovation and collaboration.It's not about being the top or the best, it's about how you approach problems and work with others to bring unique solutions to the table.This company, by implying that they're superior to everyone else in Toronto, is not only misguided but also alienating potential collaborators who might have valuable insights.

I'm all for supporting local businesses, but when they feed into the false narrative of elitism, I'm less likely to support them.Let's challenge this notion and foster a community where everyone feels empowered to contribute their skills, regardless of their perceived status as best or top. 

In conclusion, while there might be talented developers at Software Development Company Toronto, the way they present themselves comes off as arrogant and uninviting.It's time we celebrate diversity in tech rather than elevating a select few.",,805,-1,1679,909,49.0,-1,

Well, well, if it isn't our good ol' boys at Palantir snaking their way into another government contract.This time they've managed to score a deal with the VA for some fancy data analytics during this pandemic.Now, I'm no expert in tech or contracts, but it seems like these guys are always right there in the thick of things when it comes to government work and that raises some eyebrows.

I gotta say, reading through this article feels like watching another piece of our freedom slip away.We're letting companies like Palantir get their hands dirty with sensitive information while they rake in cash from the government.It's a whole stinking mess if you ask me, especially when we're dealing with something as serious as a global pandemic.

I'm not convinced that these big tech firms are doing us any favors here.Sure, they might be good at crunching numbers and whatnot, but do they really have our best interests at heart? I don't think so.It all just feels like a way to line their pockets while the little guy gets forgotten.

And let's not forget about who's behind this company: Peter Thiel.Now there's a name that'll get some folks riled up, especially considering his history and affiliations.It doesn't take a genius to see that this is just another example of the powers that be pulling the strings from behind the scenes.

I'm sure Palantir will keep spinning their tale about how they're helping us fight this pandemic, but I ain't buying it.I'll believe our healthcare workers on the front lines, not some tech wizards looking to make a quick buck.It's just another case of too much power in the wrong hands if you ask me.",,66,-1,1680,909,269.0,-1,
1681,"TITLE: Narrative Collapse Derailing Media Agendas

The article, titled Narrative Collapse Derailing Media Agendas, seems to suggest that there's a uniformity within media narratives that's failing to account for the diverse realities on the ground.While I understand the frustration with mainstream media sometimes appearing disconnected from everyday life, especially concerning educational disparities, I have some reservations about this piece.

First off, it appears the author is trying to imply a sinister motive behind these narrative collapses, suggesting there's an intentional effort by the media to mislead or manipulate public opinion.As someone who values transparency and honesty in reporting, I'm skeptical of such blanket statements without concrete evidence.It's not always about elites derailing agendas; sometimes, it's just incompetence or a lack of resources.

Moreover, the reference to a racial academic gap nationwide feels somewhat simplistic.There are many contributing factors to educational disparities—ranging from socioeconomic status and access to quality education, to systemic issues within schools themselves.Labeling this solely as a media failure doesn't seem accurate—it's far more complex than that.

In my view, while the media can certainly improve in how they report on these issues, it's also important not to overlook the many dedicated journalists working hard to shed light on these disparities and push for change.The solution isn’t to dismiss the media wholesale but to encourage a diverse range of voices and perspectives, ensuring that stories like these are reported with nuance and depth.

I've always believed in calling out misinformation where I see it, but this article seems to paint too broad a brush across the entire media landscape.We need critical thinking and constructive dialogue if we're going to address real issues effectively.",,216,-1,1681,909,335.0,-1,

1683,"TITLE: Bitchute

I find the title and summary of this article quite intriguing, though I'm not entirely sure if it aligns with my own beliefs as someone who values both religious principles and conservative values.The concept of a video service that prioritizes creators' rights and users' freedoms and privacy sounds like an appealing initiative.

However, from a critical standpoint, the fact that Bitchute positions itself in opposition to larger platforms that have faced criticism for their content moderation practices raises questions.As someone who appreciates order and structure, I'm concerned about how such freedom might lead to the spread of misinformation or harmful content.While I recognize the importance of protecting speech, I believe a responsible approach is necessary, ensuring that we don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.

Moreover, my skepticism arises from the fact that this article doesn't provide much insight into Bitchute's actual policies and how they manage to balance individual freedoms with content regulation.It's crucial for any platform, especially one focused on fostering an environment of free speech and privacy, to have clear guidelines in place to handle controversial or harmful content.

In conclusion, while the idea behind Bitchute seems promising on paper, I remain cautious until I see concrete evidence that it can effectively balance individual liberties with responsibility.The devil is always in the details, after all.",,488,-1,1683,909,336.0,-1,

1685,"TITLE: Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2019 (2019; 116th Congress H.R.24) GovTrack.us

As a concerned citizen with deeprooted beliefs in fiscal responsibility and accountability, I find this proposed legislation intriguing yet concerning.The idea of conducting a full audit on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal reserve banks is not inherently wrong—it actually aligns with my values as an advocate for transparency in government operations.

However, when looking closer at the specifics, it does raise some red flags.For instance, while I understand the importance of ensuring that our financial institutions are held accountable for their actions, this could inadvertently lead to public unrest and confusion if details of sensitive economic strategies are laid bare before they're fully understood by those not familiar with such matters.

Moreover, I question whether a full audit would serve as an effective measure in achieving true transparency.The complexity of the Federal Reserve's operations might make it challenging for the Comptroller General of the United States to provide clear and actionable reports that could lead to meaningful oversight or policy changes.

In conclusion, while the intentions behind this act are commendable, I believe we should take a cautious approach when dealing with such sensitive economic institutions.A more balanced approach—one that still aims for greater transparency but also considers potential consequences on public trust and understanding—would likely be more beneficial in the long run.",,488,-1,1685,909,177.0,-1,
1686,"TITLE: How Quantum Computers Work | HowStuffWorks

Well, this article seems to be trying to simplify something that's already pretty complicated with quantum computers.Now, I'm no scientist, but from what I understand, these socalled quantum computers rely on the fundamental nature of our universe, which is a whole different ball game compared to good oldfashioned siliconbased computers.

The idea here is that atoms or particles at a subatomic level can exist in multiple states at once, thanks to this weird quantum mechanic stuff.And supposedly, they can process information far faster than any silicon computer out there due to the sheer volume of calculations these tiny particles could theoretically handle simultaneously.

But really, how practical are these things? I mean, it all sounds like a bunch of fancy mumbojumbo that won't ever make a tangible impact on our everyday lives.Plus, aren’t we already seeing Moore's Law slowing down when it comes to siliconbased computers? So, what’s the real deal with these quantum computers? Are they just a flashy distraction or could they actually revolutionize computing?

I'll tell you who's going to benefit from them: those big tech companies that love to stay ahead of the curve.And let's not forget about all the grants and funding pouring into this research it smells like another governmentbacked technological utopia, doesn’t it? I bet my paycheck they won't make a difference in our local communities or help small businesses get off the ground.

In short, while quantum computing might be an academic marvel, it sure as hell isn't something that'll change the world for the better.It's just another highfalutin concept that will only enrich the pockets of the elite while leaving everyone else behind.",,36,-1,1686,909,114.0,-1,

Well, it seems like the folks at Bitchute are trying to carve out their own niche in the crowded digital landscape by emphasizing creators' rights and user privacy something I can appreciate given today's political climate.However, while I find some of their values commendable, I'm not entirely convinced that their approach is as flawless as they make it sound.

First off, let's talk about how Bitchute positions itself against other platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.It's clear they're aiming for a more conservative audience pun intended since I identify with socially moderateright leaning folks who might be turned off by the overly progressive vibes of certain video hosting sites.Still, I gotta wonder if Bitchute is just creating another echo chamber instead of genuinely fostering diverse perspectives.

I'm also a bit skeptical about how well their commitment to creators and privacy will actually translate into realworld benefits for users.Sure, everyone wants their content protected and their data kept safe, but what's the practical implementation looking like? It seems to me that Bitchute might be more focused on its marketing angle than genuinely delivering a superior service.

In conclusion, while I can see some potential value in Bitchute as an alternative for those looking for a platform with a conservative edge, I'm not ready to jump on their bandwagon just yet.There's too much talk and not enough proof for me to fully buy into their promise of freedom and privacy.Guess we'll just have to wait and see how this plays out.",,749,-1,1693,910,336.0,-1,

These questions about the detained Israelis on September 11th, it's a topic that gets my blood boiling.The idea that these individuals might have been involved in a conspiracy related to the attacks is both infuriating and deeply unsettling.We're talking about a significant event in our history, an attack that left thousands dead, countless families shattered, and opened up a new era of fear for our nation.

First off, let's address the elephant in the room: Israel.This country has a complicated relationship with the United States.While they are technically our ally, I've always been wary about their true intentions.They have a history of espionage against the U.S., and it wouldn't surprise me if they were involved in something as heinous as 9/11.

In my opinion, what really matters is not the flashy title or the company's own selfdefinition but the actual work quality and client satisfaction history.It's easy for companies to label themselves as top or #1, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's true.I would want to see some independent reviews, testimonials, or even awards from reputable sources to validate these claims before considering them.

I recently experimented with various AI coding assistants and found the experience to be truly revolutionary.As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I believe that embracing new technologies like vibe coding can significantly boost our learning capabilities and efficiency.By integrating AI into the coding process, we are not only streamlining tasks but also creating an environment where creativity and innovation can flourish.

While some may argue that relying on AI for coding might detract from the handson experience, I see it as a complementary tool that enhances rather than replaces traditional methods.It allows us to focus on critical thinking and problemsolving while automating repetitive tasks.This approach not only speeds up the development process but also opens up coding to a broader audience who may struggle with conventional methods.

I understand there might be concerns about job displacement or overreliance on AI, but I firmly believe that vibe coding can create new opportunities and industries that we have yet to imagine.The key is to ensure that this technology serves as an augmentative tool rather than a replacement for human ingenuity and creativity.What are your thoughts on integrating AI more deeply into our educational systems?",,975,-1,1719,911,,-1,

AliciaKeller here, folks.I just read this article on how to list those Service Principal Names (SPNs) in Active Directory via PowerShell.Now, let me tell you something.As someone who's not exactly thrilled about Big Tech and its stranglehold over our personal data, the whole idea of having these SPNs out there makes my skin crawl.It's like they're building a giant dossier on every single one of us without even asking! Motherfucker.

But let's get technical for a moment, shall we? The article says that standard AD tools can't really help you find where an SPN is registered or list all the SPNs in your AD.That's just fucking lazy if you ask me.Why aren't they giving us better tools to manage our own data? Don't they know what it's like to have to rely on Perl and VBScript just to get some goddamn answers?

And then, there's this PowerShell script that supposedly finds all SPNs in your domain for a specific service type – in the example, they use HTTP.Listen, I'm no expert in scripting or anything, but isn't it weird how they're just throwing these scripts together without even explaining what the fuck they do? It's like, Hey, here's a magic spell to find some stuff, just trust us. Trust them? Hell no! I ain't buying that shit.

It also says something about using the directorySearcher .Net class to search for accounts with HTTP/SPNs.What the hell is that supposed to mean? Why can't we just have simple solutions that don't sound like they were plucked straight out of a science fiction novel?

The part where it creates an array and then searches through results in some sort of loop really gets my goat.It's so convoluted, it makes my head spin.And what's with the fucking keys and sorting?

Well, this TED Talk from Nick Bostrom is an interesting piece of work.He's talking about artificial intelligence getting smarter, which isn't anything new, but he makes the bold claim that it'll surpass human intelligence within this century.That's a pretty big leap of faith right there.As someone who likes to keep their feet firmly on the ground, I have some reservations about these kinds of predictions.

Bostrom is a philosopher and technologist, which means he's got an education in thinking deeply about things.But sometimes, it seems like that kind of background can make folks forget about practical reality.Sure, AI is advancing at a rapid pace, but saying it'll be as smart as us humans within this century? That's a pretty big call.

He goes on to say that once these machines are smarter than we are, they won't need any more help from us Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make. I find that statement quite arrogant.It assumes that AI will have all the answers and fill in every gap.What about human intuition? Human empathy? Sure, AI can process data faster than we can, but there's a lot more to being human than just raw processing power.

Bostrom then questions whether these smart machines will help preserve humanity or develop their own values.That's an important question, especially for those of us who value our humanity and the world as we know it.I'm not entirely convinced that these machinebeings will have the same priorities as we do.They might end up deciding that preserving humans is just a minor function compared to whatever else they decide is more important.

In summary, while Bostrom raises some interesting points about AI, his predictions and views on the matter are a bit too optimistic for my taste.I believe it's too early to make such definitive statements about where AI will take us.We need to be careful with how we develop these technologies and ensure they're aligned with human values before we start talking about them replacing us altogether.After all, there's something special about being human, and I'm not so quick to give that up without a fight.",,586,-1,1729,912,38.0,-1,

Nick Bostrom essentially argues that once computers surpass human intelligence, they will inevitably become our savior or overlord, depending on how you interpret his fatalistic vision.His perspective is narrow and detached from reality.It's all sunshine and rainbows if we worship at the altar of machine learning, but what about the potential for misuse?

1742,"TITLE: Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto

I see what they're trying to do here, but let's break this down for what it is – a blatant attempt at selfpromotion under the guise of an informative article.These top app developers from Toronto claim they offer the best solutions? Please, we've all seen these kinds of claims before and know better than to take them at face value.

The fact that they're targeting clients worldwide while based in Toronto doesn't necessarily mean their services are superior; it just means they're trying to cast a wide net.I'm skeptical about how they measure up against other software development companies outside of Toronto, not to mention those from different parts of the world with potentially greater talent pools.

What really gets my goat is that they don't provide any concrete evidence or case studies demonstrating their supposed superiority.It's all just empty claims and buzzwords designed to reel in potential clients who might not have the necessary expertise to critically evaluate these claims.I'm not buying what they're selling, and neither should anyone else without doing some proper due diligence.

In my book, this article is nothing more than a selfserving piece of marketing fluff meant to inflate their own egos and attract business by misleading people into thinking they're something special when there's no substantial proof to back it up.",,1243,-1,1742,913,49.0,-1,
1743,"Oh, for crying out loud, Kevin, you can't be serious with this puff piece.I've seen betterwritten marketing brochures from community colleges.What we have here is a thinly veiled attempt at selfaggrandizement wrapped in the guise of an informative article.They're not even trying to hide it.

I've got news for these Toronto hotshots the world doesn't revolve around the Great White North, and just because they're based in Canada's most cosmopolitan city doesn't mean their coding skills are above scrutiny.I'd wager that there are talented developers from smaller cities or even foreign tech hubs who could eat them for breakfast.

And what really ticked me off was the complete absence of any tangible evidence to back up these grandiose claims.It's like they think we're all a bunch of dumb sheep ready to flock to the latest best app development company without demanding some serious data to support their assertions.I'm not buying into this charade, and neither should anyone else who's got half a brain.

In my book, this article is nothing more than an exercise in selfcongratulatory navelgazing designed to lure in the gullible with flashy words and no substance behind them.It's a disgrace to the integrity of serious business journalism.",,252,1742,1742,913,,-1,

Well, this is quite the pickle we're in, ain't it? Over a billion Android devices out there, all running on these Qualcomm Snapdragon chips that are apparently riddled with some serious security vulnerabilities.I mean, can you believe that? It's like leaving your front door wide open for any old thief to waltz right in and help themselves.

Now, as someone who's deeply concerned about both my faith and the preservation of our nation's values, this just doesn't sit well with me.We're talking about a potential data theft problem on a scale that could compromise millions of Americans' privacy.It's like an open invitation for hackers to wreak havoc and disrupt lives.

And get this—there's no timeline in sight for when Google and these phone makers are gonna fix the issue.I'm sure we can all agree that that's just plain irresponsible.We're talking about a patch for vulnerabilities here, not some fancy new feature that can wait its turn.People's data security shouldn't be held hostage by delays and inefficiency.

I'd say it's high time these companies step up their game and give us a solid plan of action to address this mess pronto.I'm all for innovation and progress, but when it comes to something as crucial as national security and personal privacy, we can't afford any sloppiness or lack of urgency.

So yeah, the situation stinks if you ask me, and I'm not about to let it slide without speaking up about it.We need accountability here, folks.Let's get it done.",,1268,-1,1744,914,339.0,-1,

Well, isn't that a cheerful thought? This article from ZeroHedge, a website that usually has its finger on some pretty dark secrets, decides to remind us all of our inevitable mortality.While I understand the point they're trying to make that no one can cheat death forever it's a bit grim for a Monday morning.As someone who leans towards seeing the light in every situation, even if it's dim and flickering, I have to say this article hits a sour note.

The perspective here aligns with a fatalistic view of life, which isn't really my cup of tea.It's like saying, Oh well, we're all gonna die anyway, so why bother? Now, don't get me wrong; acknowledging the reality of death is crucial for living our lives to the fullest, but there has to be a balance.This article tips too far into the nether end of that scale.

In my experience, focusing on what we can control and how to make each day count is much more uplifting than wallowing in the certainty of eventual demise.Plus, it's just not very practical advice for living life or even for writing articles about it.I mean, think about it: if everyone decided that survival was a lost cause, would anyone still write an article about it? Wouldn't we all be too busy not trying to survive to bother with such trivial pursuits?

So, while ZeroHedge might have some valuable insights into the darker corners of the world, this particular piece leaves me feeling unfulfilled and uninspired.I'd rather read something that encourages us to make every second count, don't you?",,759,-1,1745,914,283.0,-1,

Well, isn't that rich? The guy who brought us the fucking popup ads is now begging for forgiveness like a thief caught in the act.I mean, come on, we all know those things are annoying as shit and have been a major pain in our butts since they first showed up back in the day.

First off, let's get one thing straight Zuckerman isn't just any old person apologizing for a minor inconvenience.No, he's part of the elite tech crowd that pushed these obnoxious ads on us, making life worse for everyone who just wanted to surf the web in peace.And now he wants forgiveness? Give me a break.

You'd think someone with his influence and wealth wouldn't be so quick to apologize unless he was feeling some heat from the public or maybe even from within his own circles.I'm not buying it.He's trying to smooth things over, sure, but that doesn't change the fact that those popup ads were a fucking nightmare.

And what really gets my goat is that this apology comes off as insincere.It feels like he's just trying to polish his image and maybe get some brownie points from the public.I mean, how hard can it be to say you're sorry when your invention has caused so much annoyance? But hey, that's what elitists do, right? They play humble when they need something.

So, here we are, with this guy someone who helped shape the internet as we know it today begging for forgiveness.I'm not buying it.Popup ads were a fucking disaster, and his apology doesn't change that fact one bit.He's just another rich tech bro trying to save face after causing a ruckus.

Let's call this guy out for what he is: someone who made something super annoying and now wants us to think he's sorry.But actions speak louder than words, right? Actions like taking responsibility and actually fixing the problem would mean more than some halfassed apology from someone with deep pockets.

Sorry, but I'm not falling for it.",,294,-1,1750,914,340.0,-1,
