1,All About Skimmers – Krebs on Security,"These skimmer articles sure are a hit, huh? And guess what? It's probably because most folks out there don't have a clue about how easily their information can be swiped right from under their noses. The media loves to play up the big, bad hackers sitting in a dark room somewhere, but let me tell you something—any schmuck with half a brain and some cheap hardware from China can stick a skimmer on an ATM and walk away with all the credit card numbers they need. Now I'm not saying Krebs doesn't have valuable information here. He's done his research, no doubt about it. But you'd think that after all these years, we'd be taking more serious action against this shit. Instead of just warning people (which is important, don't get me wrong), why aren't banks and governments doing something effective to protect us? It's all just a big game of whackamole. And let's talk about encryption for a second. If we were using strong encryption on our credit cards instead of this easilycracked shit, maybe these skimmers wouldn't be such a problem anymore. But no, the financial elite want to keep things simple and cheap, so we all have to deal with this mess. I'm just tired of hearing about how I need to watch out for skimmers every time I go to an ATM or pump gas. We should be focusing on solutions that put power back in the hands of the people, not just reminding us to be vigilant like good little sheep. Krebs is right to inform us, but it's high time we started demanding real change instead of playing defense all the time.","All About Skimmers – Krebs on Security These skimmer articles sure are a hit, huh?

6,"Linux, SteamOS, Steam Deck gaming | GamingOnLinux","Well, this article seems to be pretty focused on the world of Linux gaming, which I gotta say isn't really my cup of tea. As someone who's all about supporting business establishments and whatnot, I find it a bit weird that there's so much love for something that seems more like a niche market. But hey, each to their own, right? The thing is, from a ProBusiness Establishment Right perspective, we're all about efficiency, making money, cutting costs, and you know, the whole capitalist gig. I'm not really sure how Linux gaming fits into that picture since it seems more like something for tech geeks who want to live in their own little world. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's bad or anything; I just don't see the appeal. SteamOS and Steam Deck gaming? Sounds like a bunch of hippie stuff to me. What's next, playing games on a freaking toaster? Give me a break. And these Indie Game Reviews, are people actually reading this crap? It's all very...quaint. Now, I'm not saying that the people who enjoy this sort of thing are dumb or anything. Far from it. But honestly, when you're dealing with something as mainstream and profitable as gaming, why would you want to mess around with some weirdo operating system that nobody uses? It just doesn't make sense in a business sense. I mean, sure, there's this whole opensource thing going on with Linux, but who really cares? I'm all about proprietary technology that makes money. That's what gets things done. So yeah, while it's interesting and all to see people excited about their fancy Linux gaming setups, I'm not buying it. Give me a good ol' fashioned Windows or Mac any day of the week. In conclusion, this article is just another example of how some folks in the tech world can get way too caught up in their own little bubbles. It's all fun and games until someone has to pay the bills and keep the economy running smoothly. And that someone usually isn't the Linux gaming community.","Linux, SteamOS, Steam Deck gaming | GamingOnLinux Well, this article seems to be pretty focused on the world of Linux gaming, which I gotta say isn't really my cup of tea.

8,Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias,"These selfproclaimed media watchdogs at Newsbusters think they're doing us a favor by exposing the supposed liberal media bias? Please, I've got news for them there's nothing liberal about exposing truth. They want to defend America's founding principles? How about actually understanding and upholding them instead of cherrypicking what suits their narrow worldview? The Media Research Center is just another rightwing echo chamber looking for bogeymen in every corner, desperately trying to fit the world into their rigid religious and patriotic framework. It's laughable how they claim to combat censorship while actively promoting a skewed narrative that serves only to reinforce their own beliefs. And let's not forget about the taxdeductible contributions always a nice touch when you're peddling propaganda disguised as research. But hey, I guess if it helps preserve their version of America, why not milk the system for all it's worth? In conclusion, these folks at Newsbusters are nothing but modernday book burners, desperately trying to control what we see and read. Their zealotry in enforcing a particular brand of Americanism is both misguided and dangerous. It's time we called them out on their hypocrisy and demanded more from our media outlets objectivity, integrity, and truth, not just a warped reflection of the ReligiousPatriot Conservative ideology.","Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias These selfproclaimed media watchdogs at Newsbusters think they're doing us a favor by exposing the supposed liberal media bias?

9,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, ain't that a load of hooey right there. Nick Bostrom's sitting up there on his high horse preachin' about how AI is gonna come along and put us all under its thumb. Oh no, he says, we gotta watch out for them smart machines. I don't know what kind of koolaid that man's been drinkin', but it ain't from the same well as me. First off, let's talk about this whole getting smarter business. Smart ain't always better. I got a kid who can recite Shakespeare like a pro, but he can't hold down a job 'cause he don't know jack shit about hard work. And that there is as smart as we're supposed to be? No thank you. And then Bostrom starts yammering on about how AI could be as smart as us humans within this century. Yeah, sure. I got a bridge to sell ya if you believe in that horse manure. We can't even get rid of the damn bugs in our software after all these years; what makes him think we're suddenly gonna magically create something on par with human intelligence? It's just plain laughable. Now he says AI is the last invention we'll ever need. What a crock! The last thing we need is more tech clogging up our lives and leading us further away from the simple things that make life worth livin'. I betcha Bostrom ain't one to turn off his damn computer and go for a walk in nature. And don't even get me started on him askin' about values. What's he talkin' about? We got our values right here, thank you very much. Don't need some machine tellin' us what's right or wrong. Our granddaddies worked hard to build this country and pass down these values; ain't no machine gonna change that. So yeah, Bostrom can stick his AI up his ass for all I care. We don't need no smart machines runnin' the show. Humans were just fine before we started codin' everything, and we'll be just fine after they throw in the towel.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, ain't that a load of hooey right there.

11,Disconnect Search: Search privately using your favorite search engine,"Well, this article seems to come from a pretty neutral standpoint, focusing on the tech aspect of private searching rather than delving into any political or social commentary. I'm not really sure what kind of angle they're trying to push here, but it doesn't seem to align with my own perspective as someone who leans towards being critical of elite structures. In essence, this Disconnect Search thing is about using your preferred search engine while keeping your searches private. It's like, Hey, don't worry about Big Brother watching you; just use whatever search bar you're comfortable with. While I agree that privacy matters—hell, everyone should want their searches to be private—I'm not sure how effective this solution really is in today's tech landscape. The whole thing just feels a bit too simplistic for my taste. It doesn't tackle the deeper issues of data collection and surveillance by corporations or governments. There's no mention of alternatives like DuckDuckGo, which has been explicitly designed with privacy as its core focus from day one. The article seems to trust that users will magically start using more private search engines without actually giving them any real reasons to do so. It's a bit like trying to fix the roof while ignoring the foundation. I mean, sure, cookies might be used for remembering your search preferences, but it's just a small part of the overall problem. It doesn't address the elephant in the room—these companies are selling your data to the highest bidder or handing it over to the government without so much as a byyourleave. In conclusion, Disconnect Search is an okay idea on paper, but if we're going to talk about real privacy, we need to be talking about more than just cookies. We need to talk about dismantling these corporate data collection behemoths and giving people actual reasons to care about their online privacy. This article feels like a drop in the bucket.","Disconnect Search: Search privately using your favorite search engine Well, this article seems to come from a pretty neutral standpoint, focusing on the tech aspect of private searching rather than delving into any political or social commentary.

12,RIP the rest of the industry: iPhone X's A11 chip has 6 independently addressable CPU cores,"Well, well, isn't this just another example of how Apple is setting the standard and leaving everyone else to play catch up? This news about the A11 chip in the upcoming iPhone X having six independently addressable CPU cores is quite frankly a smack in the face to all those other companies trying to compete. I mean, if you can't create something groundbreaking like this, are you even worth following? Now, I'm not saying that just because Apple does it, it's automatically the best thing since sliced bread. But, given their track record, it's hard not to at least acknowledge that they know what they're doing when it comes to innovation in technology. I do find it a bit amusing, though, how some folks might view this as an admission of defeat by other tech companies—like they should just throw in the towel because Apple came up with something impressive. But hey, if the shoe fits, right? Let's see what these other companies are made of; maybe they'll surprise us and come out swinging. In any case, I guess we're in for some exciting times with this new iPhone X and its A11 chip. Can't wait to see how it performs!","RIP the rest of the industry: iPhone X's A11 chip has 6 independently addressable CPU cores Well, well, isn't this just another example of how Apple is setting the standard and leaving everyone else to play catch up?

14,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, I gotta say, these ideas from this guy Nick Bostrom just make me think about the whole direction our society is headed in. Now, I'm no expert on tech or artificial intelligence, but what he's saying seems to align with some of my beliefs as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative type person. The idea that computers could get smarter than us humans? It does sound like science fiction, but when you think about it, it ain't too farfetched neither. The thing is, I'm not sure if this is something we should be excited about or worried about. For one, it's kinda scary to imagine a world where machines are way smarter than us. If they get their own values and stuff, who knows what kind of impact that could have on our society? Would these smart machines still uphold the things we hold dear like family, community, country? Or would they just follow some cold, logical algorithm? Now, I know some folks out there love talking about how technology is gonna save us from all sorts of problems. But I'm not so sure. It sounds to me like Nick Bostrom might be a bit too optimistic about what these smart machines can do for us. And who knows? Maybe he's even a little naive about the kind of power they could have. I mean, look at how some people already use tech to mess with our lives. Privacy gone, jobs disappearing, and all that jazz. Why should we think that supersmart computers would be any different? They might end up doing more harm than good if we're not careful. So yeah, while it's interesting to hear what Nick Bostrom has to say about this stuff, I'm gonna keep my eyes open and maybe even cross them a bit when it comes to these smart machines. We gotta be careful who we trust with power, right?","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, I gotta say, these ideas from this guy Nick Bostrom just make me think about the whole direction our society is headed in.

19,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well folks, let me tell you something about this idea these eggheads at TED Talks love to peddle. This Bostrom guy is pushing the notion that AI's gonna outsmart us and take over. He's playing with fire there, talking about machines getting as smart as humans by the century's end. Yeah right, like we ain't already in too deep with these contraptions. Now, I'm no scientist or philosopher, but it seems to me this guy is spouting off some pretty wild stuff without much concrete evidence to back it up. We're supposed to believe that once AI catches up to human brainpower, it'll just keep on truckin', surpassing us like we're standing still. That's a mighty big leap of faith he wants us to take. And get this – Bostrom claims we won't need to make any more inventions after that! Like creating smarter machines is the ultimate goal for humanity. What about all the other problems we got? Hunger, poverty, inequality? Nah, let's just set our sights on building a machine that can outthink us. Priorities, right? But what really gets my goat is when people like Bostrom start talking about AI values. Values, schmaltzes! We're talking about machines here, not sentient beings. They don't have feelings or empathy; they just process information faster than we do. The idea that these machines could develop their own values? That's just a recipe for disaster. So while I understand the curiosity and concern behind Bostrom's talk, I think he's getting way ahead of himself. We ain't ready to start worrying about AI taking over our jobs or our lives – not yet, anyway. Let's focus on fixing the real problems in this world first before we get spooked by some philosopher's worstcase scenario. This TED Talk stuff might sound all fancy and cuttingedge, but when you strip it down, it's just another bunch of what ifs that ain't gonna help anyone anytime soon.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well folks, let me tell you something about this idea these eggheads at TED Talks love to peddle.

20,Crytek eliminates five studios after struggling to pay employees | PC Gamer,"Crytek's decision to cut down five of their studios is a clear sign that the gaming industry can't keep up with the reckless spending habits of big corporations. They claim it's about focusing on premium IPs, but let's call it what it really is an attempt to cling onto profitability by slashing costs wherever possible, including staff wages. Now, I'm not saying Crytek doesn't have the right to restructure their business as they see fit, but there's something fundamentally wrong with how these companies operate. They're more concerned about lining the pockets of their executives than ensuring fair pay for the people who actually make these games. It's a classic case of the elite hoarding resources while the workers are left high and dry. The gaming industry needs to rethink its priorities; it shouldn't be about profit margins and market dominance but about creating genuine experiences that enrich our lives. By laying off employees and shutting down studios, Crytek is not just hurting their own workforce, they're also stifling innovation and creativity—two things that are crucial for the survival of any game development studio. The fact that this news comes from a center source only goes to show how far removed these establishments can be from reality. It's time we question why we allow these corporations to dictate the narrative without holding them accountable for their actions. The real losers here aren't just the employees who lost their jobs but also the gamers who will soon feel the consequences of a less diverse and innovative gaming landscape. In this situation, I agree with Crytek's decision to focus on fewer projects, but it should be a means to ensure better pay and working conditions for their staff rather than simply making ends meet. The industry needs a change in its core values; one that puts people over profits and creativity over greed.","Crytek eliminates five studios after struggling to pay employees | PC Gamer Crytek's decision to cut down five of their studios is a clear sign that the gaming industry can't keep up with the reckless spending habits of big corporations.

21,"Apple, Google, Intel And Adobe Still Headed For Trial Over Wage Collusion Pact","These tech giants are about to face a trial for colluding on wages. The big tech firms in the Valley agreed not to hire each other's engineers, so they could keep salaries low and maintain their stranglehold over the market. This is yet another example of how these companies use their power to screw over workers and enrich themselves.

22,MetaGeek | Visualize your WiFi,"This article seems to be about a company called MetaGeek that aims to improve the WiFi experience by providing tools to troubleshoot and optimize wireless networks. While I understand the importance of reliable internet connectivity, especially in today's digital age where everything from commerce to education is increasingly dependent on it, my primary focus lies elsewhere. As someone who holds strong beliefs about traditional values and family unity, I find myself questioning the necessity of such advanced technology that often pulls people away from facetoface interactions. It's a bit concerning to see so much effort being put into something that can sometimes divide families or lead individuals down paths of isolation when they could be engaging in more meaningful activities. I also want to point out that while this service is aimed at helping fix WiFi issues, there seems to be an underlying assumption that the primary concern for users should be the uninterrupted flow of data. From a ReligiousPatriot Conservative standpoint, I believe our priorities should lie elsewhere: nurturing family bonds, preserving cultural heritage, and reinforcing community values. In conclusion, while MetaGeek's tech can certainly be useful in maintaining modern conveniences, it is crucial that we do not lose sight of what truly matters in life. We need to strike a balance between embracing technology for its practical uses and ensuring that we're not sacrificing the more important aspects of human connection in the process.","MetaGeek | Visualize your WiFi This article seems to be about a company called MetaGeek that aims to improve the WiFi experience by providing tools to troubleshoot and optimize wireless networks.

24,Pakistan asks Facebook and Twitter to help identify blasphemers | Pakistan's blasphemy laws | The Guardian,"These bleedingheart tech giants are being suckered into a deeply flawed system. How fucking convenient for the Pakistani government to point their crooked finger at these platforms, asking them to root out socalled blasphemers. This is nothing more than a witch hunt disguised as law enforcement. What's next? Asking social media companies to identify people who dare to question the government's bullshit policies? It's sickening how easily these companies are swayed by authoritarian regimes that have no qualms about silencing dissent. If they truly gave a shit about freedom of speech, they'd tell Pakistan to go fuck itself instead of bowing down like the lapdogs they are. But no, they're all about making a quick buck and pretending to be socially conscious—until it's inconvenient. And what about these blasphemy laws anyway? They're just another tool for the ruling elite to maintain their power by controlling public opinion. It's a fucking disgrace that in this day and age, people are still being persecuted for expressing themselves freely. I'd say Facebook and Twitter should refuse to cooperate with this bullshit request, but I know they won't have the balls to do so. They'll cave in like the spineless motherfuckers they are, all for the sake of their bottom line and the illusion that they're doing some good in this world.

We need to be focusing on building strong families, supporting our troops, and keeping the American way of life alive — not coddling these socalled thinking machines that could supposedly take over one day. I bet Bostrom is just a sore loser who can't stand the fact that he ain't got no fancy tech job to call his own.

28,"Malcolm Gladwell’s Blink, Part 2, Listening with your Eyes – James Boldin's Horn World","In this followup to Malcolm Gladwell's Blink, which explored the power of instinctive decisionmaking, we're diving into a fascinating exploration of how our eyes—and our willingness to listen—play crucial roles in music education and performance. Specifically, the article focuses on James Boldin's journey with the French horn, intertwining personal growth with technical mastery. Gladwell's work often challenges conventional wisdom by emphasizing the importance of intuition and snap judgments. In this case, he examines how observing musicians like Boldin can teach us to trust our instincts and improve our listening skills, which are integral for both teachers and students in music education. My take on this? I'm absolutely intrigued by the idea that something as nuanced as musical expression can be understood through intuitive observation. However, where I part ways with Gladwell's perspective is when it starts to lean towards an overestimation of the power of intuition. While there's no doubt that watching and listening to experienced musicians like Boldin can offer invaluable insights, it seems almost dismissive of the structured learning processes that have shaped their abilities. Music education is a rigorous discipline requiring both technical skill and creative expression—reducing it to mere observation undermines the hard work and dedication involved. Moreover, I find some fault in Gladwell's suggestion that our eyes play a significant role in listening. While visual cues are undeniably important in communicating emotions and intentions during music performance, they shouldn't overshadow the auditory experience or the auditory learning process. Music is fundamentally an aural art form; while visuals can enhance understanding, they should complement rather than replace focused listening. In conclusion, while I appreciate Gladwell's insights into the interconnectedness of observation, intuition, and learning, especially in the context of music education, I believe there needs to be a balance struck between trusting our instincts and acknowledging the value of formal training. After all, the horn isn't just an instrument; it's a testament to years of disciplined practice and study.","Malcolm Gladwell’s Blink, Part 2, Listening with your Eyes – James Boldin's Horn World In this followup to Malcolm Gladwell's Blink, which explored the power of instinctive decisionmaking, we're diving into a fascinating exploration of how our eyes—and our willingness to listen—play crucial roles in music education and performance.

38,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, this talk from Nick Bostrom got me thinking about something that's pretty important to the people I care about. First off, you gotta understand where I'm coming from I don't trust big brains outside of my own head. These socalled smart computers they're always talking about? They ain’t nothing but fancy machines made by folks who think they know better than us regular Joes. Now, Bostrom's got this idea that these AI machines are gonna get so smart they'll just up and take over from us. And let me tell you, if you ask me, he might be onto something there. Smart ain’t always good; it’s how you use it that counts. These tech wizards keep pushing the limits, but what's to say they won't push us out of the way? Bostrom talks about this century as some kind of magic window where these AIs get to be as smart as us and then boom, we're done for. Done for? I don’t think so humanity’s pretty resilient. We've faced tough times before and kept on going. But if you ask me, it's the folks behind all this AI tech that we should keep an eye on. The thing is, Bostrom seems to be having a bit of a crisis here about whether these machines will help us or go rogue. I don’t think he’s really considering who’s in control those making the AIs aren't exactly known for putting the little guy first. So yeah, we better watch our backs with this AI stuff because smart doesn’t mean it can look out for us if it ain’t programmed to do just that. In the end, what I take away from Bostrom’s talk is a big ol’ dose of skepticism. We gotta be careful who we trust with all these fancy gadgets and that includes the folks telling us they know best.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, this talk from Nick Bostrom got me thinking about something that's pretty important to the people I care about. First off, you gotta understand where I'm coming from I don't trust big brains outside of my own head. These socalled smart computers they're always talking about? They ain’t nothing but fancy machines made by folks who think they know better than us regular Joes. Now, Bostrom's got this idea that these AI machines are gonna get so smart they'll just up and take over from us. And let me tell you, if you ask me, he might be onto something there. Smart ain’t always good; it’s how you use it that counts. These tech wizards keep pushing the limits, but what's to say they won't push us out of the way? Bostrom talks about this century as some kind of magic window where these AIs get to be as smart as us and then boom, we're done for. Done for? I don’t think so humanity’s pretty resilient. We've faced tough times before and kept on going. But if you ask me, it's the folks behind all this AI tech that we should keep an eye on.

39,Welcome to devuan.org | Devuan GNU+Linux Free Operating System,"Well, this is a nice piece of news for those who value their freedom in the digital world. Devuan's approach to offering a free operating system seems pretty solid, especially when you consider all the liberties it grants users with its opensource philosophy. From my perspective as someone who cherishes tradition and individual rights, I find this initiative quite appealing. It speaks directly to the core values of selfreliance and nonsubmission that I hold dear. The freedom to customize and share your software modifications without asking permission? That's the kind of independence we should all fight for. However, there is a subtle concern here that aligns with my beliefs about responsibility. While this system encourages sharing knowledge, it also means users are expected to understand what they're altering in their systems. It's a doubleedged sword; on one hand, you have the freedom to innovate, but on the other, you bear the full weight of your actions if something goes wrong. In summary, I find Devuan's mission compatible with my beliefs about personal autonomy and selfsufficiency. Yet, I also believe in the importance of accountability that comes with such liberties—something this article touches upon but doesn't fully explore.","Welcome to devuan.org | Devuan GNU+Linux Free Operating System Well, this is a nice piece of news for those who value their freedom in the digital world.

40,Why the military can’t quit Windows XP.,"I gotta say, this article is kinda missing the mark. I mean, sure, we get it, Windows XP has been around for ages and it's got its nostalgic value. But when you're dealing with national security and all that jazz, shouldn't you be focusing on the future? There’s gotta be a balance between sticking to what you know and keeping up with the times. Now, I ain’t no tech whiz, but doesn’t upgrading your operating systems mean better protection against threats like cyberattacks? And if it's a matter of life and death as they say, wouldn't investing in newer technologies be more responsible? I don’t get why the military can’t just move on. It feels like clinging to an old pair of jeans that are comfortable but probably not healthy for your body in the long run. The article might have some points about the hassle factor, but I think it's overlooking the bigger picture. So yeah, while I see where they're coming from, I'm gonna have to call bull on this one. It’s time to stop looking back and start focusing on what’s best for our military’s future.","Why the military can’t quit Windows XP. I gotta say, this article is kinda missing the mark.

41,Most Expensive Apps for iPhone and iPad Business Insider,"Well, ain't that something. We all know them fancy Apple gadgets are pricey enough as it stands, but now we're talking about apps? That's just ludicrous! I mean, when was the last time you paid money for an app? Hell, most of us are used to getting everything for free on these devices. Now, I ain't got no love for Apple or their highfalutin store, but it tickles my pickle to see them trying to squeeze more money outta folks with overpriced apps. Sure, there might be some fancyschmancy ones that doctors and lawyers use, but most of these expensive apps are probably just a bunch of hot air and useless features. I reckon the only people who'd pay top dollar for an app are those city slickers who flaunt their cash around like it's going outta style. As for me? I stick to my good ol' fashioned notebook and pen, thank you very much. Ain't nobody paying me to use some overpriced fancy pants app! So, kudos to Business Insider for pointing this one out. It's always good to keep an eye on where our hardearned cash is going. But honestly? I ain't buying what they're selling not at those prices, anyway.","Most Expensive Apps for iPhone and iPad Business Insider Well, ain't that something.

42,Save WiFi/Individual Comments LibrePlanet,"Well, I must say, the title itself seems to lean towards an individualistic perspective which is something I can definitely get behind. However, as I dive into the summary, I start to see some red flags that make me question whether this article truly aligns with my beliefs. The update about WiFi and individual comments in LibrePlanet, a free software conference, suggests they're advocating for keeping these aspects open and unrestricted. While I agree on the importance of innovation and personal expression, which is crucial for business growth and establishment, there's also a fine line to walk here. The term center political leaning doesn't exactly scream ProBusiness Establishment Right to me. LibrePlanet seems like an event that promotes free software, which can be seen as a form of protectionism against the tech industry giants – something I'm not too fond of, especially when it comes to stifling competition and innovation. There's also the risk of creating monopolies within these open platforms, which is a classic example of how regulation can hurt the very businesses it aims to protect. While I understand the appeal of keeping WiFi free for attendees, there needs to be a balance struck here. If we're talking about saving something as vital as WiFi and individual comments, perhaps we ought to rethink our approach to business in such events. Maybe incorporating more businessfriendly elements could foster an environment where both innovation and personal expression can thrive without one overshadowing the other. I'm all for free speech and open communication, but I also believe that a healthy balance is key. We must ensure that these principles don't inadvertently create barriers or hinder growth within our own ranks – the ProBusiness Establishment Right. It's time to save WiFi and individual comments in LibrePlanet, but perhaps not at the expense of what we stand for: progress and productivity.","Save WiFi/Individual Comments LibrePlanet Well, I must say, the title itself seems to lean towards an individualistic perspective which is something I can definitely get behind.

46,Bitchute,"Honestly, I find the whole concept of Bitchute both intriguing and concerning at the same time. On one hand, it's refreshing to see a platform prioritize its content creators and focus on user privacy in a world where tech giants often seem to be violating our rights left and right. It feels like a breath of fresh air, especially for those who are deeply concerned about their online security and freedom of expression. However, I can't shake off the feeling that there might be more to this story than meets the eye. The fact that they're seemingly taking an opposing stance to the Big Tech companies makes me wonder if there's a hidden agenda at play here. It’s like they’re setting themselves up as some kind of antiestablishment bastion, and while I'm all for sticking it to the man, I've learned to be cautious when something seems too good—or too rebellious—to be true. It's also worth considering how this platform is funded and who ultimately controls it. The devil's in the details, after all, and we shouldn't blindly trust any entity just because they talk a good game about freedom and privacy. I might end up using Bitchute, but I'll definitely be keeping my eyes wide open for any signs of hypocrisy or ulterior motives.","Bitchute Honestly, I find the whole concept of Bitchute both intriguing and concerning at the same time.

The idea that we should treat them equally? That's just bullshit. Hackerspaces are just for socializing and learning, while hacklabs actually matter because they fight the system.

I mean, come on, using field work from a defunct hacklab in London? That's not gonna convince anyone who knows what's up. And this socalled Hungarian Autonomous Center for Knowledge?

48,Worst States for Human Trafficking 20152017 Human Trafficking Search,"I got to say, I find it pretty ironic that we're focusing on Worst States when really, we should be talking about how each state can improve its efforts against human trafficking. It's like the whole thing is set up to point fingers rather than encourage progress. First off, I've gotta note that this article is coming from a seemingly neutral position. But let me tell you what I think – it's a classic case of the political elite trying to control the narrative and shift our focus away from systemic issues. Instead of talking about which states are worst, we should be discussing how every state can work together to combat this issue effectively. The whole idea that there are bad states and good states when it comes to human trafficking is a load of shit. It's like saying some people are more susceptible to being trafficked than others – newsflash, everyone has the right not to be exploited. We need to start seeing human trafficking for what it is: a major issue that requires cooperation from all levels of society, not just fingerpointing at certain states. And let me tell you something about those who run these hotlines and report cases. They're just trying to get more funding by scaring people into thinking their state is one of the worst. Don't get me wrong, human trafficking is a terrible crime that needs to be addressed, but we need to address it as a collective problem, not a competition between states. It's all about taking responsibility and working together. We shouldn't just focus on which states have the most reported cases – we should talk about prevention strategies, education, and community outreach programs. I bet if everyone put in the same effort, we'd see a significant decrease in trafficking across the board. In conclusion, this article is nothing but a thinly veiled attempt to create division among states and distract us from real action. We need to be smarter than that and work together as a nation to tackle human trafficking – not just point fingers at which state is supposedly worst.","Worst States for Human Trafficking 20152017 Human Trafficking Search I got to say, I find it pretty ironic that we're focusing on Worst States when really, we should be talking about how each state can improve its efforts against human trafficking.

It's not like we're picking our preferences like we'd pick out a pair of shoes at the mall. Bisexuality isn't about being nonchalant or casual; it's about genuine attraction to both genders. Now, I know some folks might argue that this term helps break down traditional gender roles and expectations, but honestly, isn't it just perpetuating another kind of binary thinking? We're not all fluid in our desires like a glass of water on a summer's day. Some of us are straight, some of us are gay, and the rest of us might be somewhere else entirely. But let's not pretend that we can just be bi by the way like it's nothing more than a casual fashion choice. And what really gets my goat is how this term seems to downplay the experience of those who don't identify as strictly bi. Like, yeah, bisexuality is a real thing, but let's not erase the rest of the spectrum just because we want a catchy phrase that rolls off the tongue. It's like saying all poets are bards and all bards are rappers; it doesn’t make any sense. So, while I understand where this term comes from, I think we can do better than Bi the Way.

It seems that despite geopolitical tensions and trade wars, these massive corporations have still managed to thrive. However, I can't help but feel that the real issue lies in how these enormous profits are distributed among stakeholders—often times, shareholders reap the benefits while local businesses suffer or are gobbled up by bigger entities. The concentration of wealth in such a small percentage of global companies might not be the most equitable outcome, especially when it comes to fostering healthy competition and economic resilience across nations. Moreover, the list's creation seems to focus on market value and profits that can easily be influenced by shortterm stock market fluctuations rather than longterm sustainability or contributions to societal welfare. It's a stark reminder of how the corporate world often diverges from the broader social impact it could have if it prioritized community involvement and fair trade practices. In conclusion, while Forbes' list provides insights into global economic powerhouses, I can't help but feel that there are more nuanced factors at play beyond just market value.

It ain't a fair comparison when one company is aiming for the moon and the other is more like taking a hot air balloon ride to the edge of space. And let's not forget that SpaceX has been doing this reusable rocket thing for a bit longer now, so it's not exactly fair to say they're falling behind just because Blue Origin pulled off a quick win. It takes time, resources, and a whole lot of trial and error to make something like this work. The space industry is diverse now, sure, but that doesn't mean we gotta start tearing each other down instead of lifting each other up. Both companies have their merits, and it's high time we stop the unnecessary comparisons and just let them do their thing—because when it comes right down to it, we all win in this game.","Don't Compare Blue Origin's Success to SpaceX's Failures | TechCrunch I gotta say, this whole comparing apples and oranges thing is getting old with some folks out there.

65,Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto,"This article seems to promote a typical corporate view of hiring the best app developers, without much substance or critical analysis about what makes them the top choice. In my opinion, it's just another example of the ProBusiness Establishment narrative that often glosses over the actual quality and value of services offered. While I appreciate the importance of a robust digital presence in today's marketdriven economy, I find this article's approach to be somewhat lacking. It doesn't provide any tangible evidence or criteria for what makes their app developers exceptional. It seems more like an advertisement than a genuine exploration into the challenges and solutions within software development. The fact that they tout being the top mobile app development agency in Toronto without specifics is just a buzzword meant to attract readers with empty promises. As someone who values transparency, I believe it's crucial for articles like this one to dive deeper into the methodologies and innovations their developers bring to the table rather than simply stating they are the best. The ProBusiness Establishment often falls short in its rhetoric by neglecting the real innovation that comes from diverse perspectives and competitive markets, not just those with a flashy website or an impressive portfolio of superficially attractive projects. It's also worth questioning why hiring in Toronto would necessarily mean getting the best developers? There are talented programmers all around the world who might offer better value for money or bring unique skills to the table. This kind of narrow geographic focus seems like a lazy approach to talent acquisition and could potentially overlook exceptional opportunities elsewhere. In summary, I believe that while there's certainly some merit in hiring experienced professionals from reputable companies, this article falls short by not providing enough critical analysis or depth into what makes these developers stand out. It feels more like an attempt to dominate the search results with a bold claim rather than engaging readers with substantial content.","Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto This article seems to promote a typical corporate view of hiring the best app developers, without much substance or critical analysis about what makes them the top choice.

68,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, I've got some thoughts on this TED talk stuff. First off, the whole idea that these computer nerds think they can create something that's gonna be as smart as us humans is pretty damn laughable. I mean, come on, who the hell does Bostrom think he is? Some genius philosopher or whatever, and he's got the nerve to tell me about AI surpassing human intelligence? Pfft. Now, let me get this straight – we're supposed to believe that a computer, which can only do what it's been programmed to do, is gonna just up and become selfaware like some scifi bullshit? Give me a break. I've got more faith in the common sense of your average Joe than in any machine. And then there's this whole spiel about machines needing values of their own. What the hell does that even mean? We're talking about a chunk of metal and wires, folks. It ain't got no soul, it ain't got no feelings; it's just code on a chip. And you want me to believe it's gonna start caring about humanity and our values? Yeah right. Bostrom is basically saying that we should be worried about these machines taking over like some kind of dystopian nightmare. I say bring it on, motherfucker. If we can create something that makes our jobs easier, hell yeah we should use it. That's what progress is all about – making life better for the establishment and those who work hard. And let me guess, Bostrom's gonna tell us to be scared of this overwhelming machine intelligence? I ain't buying it. We've been dealing with technology advancements every day; we're not a bunch of scaredycats hiding in the dark waiting for some AI boogeyman. Bring on the smart machines – they might just save our bacon. So, to sum it all up, this Nick Bostrom guy can take his TED talk and shove it where the sun don't shine. I ain't buying into any of his fearmongering bullshit. We're not gonna cower before some machine that supposedly has more intelligence than us humans. That's just plain stupid.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, I've got some thoughts on this TED talk stuff.

On one hand, I appreciate the mission of documenting and combating falsehoods in the media. It's crucial to hold journalists accountable for their work, especially when it comes to how they cover important issues that affect our country. On the other hand, I find it concerning when these efforts seem to focus heavily on challenging liberal media outlets while possibly overlooking or downplaying conservative ones' potential flaws. To me, it feels like an imbalance in approach one that could be seen as problematic for the health of our democracy.

The summary is straightforward enough; it provides translations for terms related to bisexuality, which is an important topic in our society today. However, considering myself deeply rooted in traditional values as a conservative, I can't help but feel that the article lacks depth and fails to address the broader implications of embracing such identities within our culture. It's almost as if the author deliberately avoids delving into the social and moral aspects that might challenge certain beliefs. In my opinion, while it is essential to acknowledge and respect individual sexual orientations, we shouldn't shy away from discussing how they intersect with longstanding conservative values like family integrity, moral standards, and societal norms. It's a delicate balance that this article seems reluctant to tackle headon. Overall, I find the content of Bi the Way somewhat lacking in substance. As someone who seeks to understand these issues within the context of my deeply held beliefs, I wished for more insight into how traditional values could coexist with modern sexual orientations.

It's not like we're asking for a safe space or anything. This article is just a bunch of corporate nonsense trying to justify their decision.

But that doesn't mean we should just throw caution to the wind and go chasing after something as fleeting as a digital currency. There has to be a middle ground where we balance innovation with prudence. This cryptocurrency fad? It ain't it. So, Home Magazine, before you go and tell people to jump on this bandwagon, maybe do some real research or talk to someone who knows what they're doing. Because from where I'm standing, all I see is a bunch of hot air and dubious promises.","Home Magazine DeDevelopers Well, isn't that just peachy? A whole article about how cryptocurrencies are all the rage these days because they're so decentralized and secure. I mean, who wouldn't want to be part of some digital coin circus where nobody's really in control? It's like a wild west ghost town out here with no sheriff in sight. Now, let me tell you something. As someone who values stability and order, the idea of having your money float around on the internet, not tied to anything tangible or Godgiven, is downright unsettling.

85,Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto,"These guys think they're something special, huh? Claiming to be the top at everything just because they've got a nice office downtown doesn't mean squat if their code is shit and they can't deliver results. I've seen plenty of socalled top companies that couldn't hack it when it really mattered. It's all talk until you see them stumble over their own feet when things get real. I'm not buying the we're the best line, especially when it comes from a company in Toronto. Don't get me wrong; I've got nothing against Torontonians. But this whole best Android & iOS solutions thing? It sounds like they've drunk the KoolAid on their own marketing pitch. There's no substance behind those words unless they can back it up with realworld success stories and not just press releases. And what's with that summary? They say clients worldwide. That's supposed to impress who, exactly? I've got news for them: we live in a global economy where anyone can claim to have clients all over the world. It doesn't mean they're actually doing anything meaningful or impactful. So here's my take: let's see their work, not just their words. Can they walk the talk? Or are they just another pack of suits with a fancy website and too much hot air? I'll believe it when I see some genuine results from them that aren't just PR spin. That goes for any company claiming to be something more than they really are.","Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto These guys think they're something special, huh?

86,GitHub ctrlcctrlv/infinity: A vichan fork permitting users to create their own boards,"The idea of this Github project seems interesting at first, but upon closer inspection, it aligns with the typical topdown solutions that I dislike. This fork is essentially a tool for techsavvy individuals who want to set up their own discussion forums or boards. While that may sound like empowering people to create their own communities, it's actually another way for a small group of programmers to dictate how we interact online. The fact that this project is being hosted on Github highlights the elitism inherent in such projects they cater primarily to those who already have access to tech resources and coding skills. It doesn't address the issue of unequal distribution of power, where only those who can code or understand complex software get to shape public discourse. This kind of tool might be seen as democratizing online spaces at first glance, but it really just reinforces the existing digital divide. In the end, this project seems like another way for a few techsavvy individuals to control narratives and exclude others from contributing meaningfully to online discussions. It's a subtle play by the elite to maintain their power over how people interact on the internet, all under the guise of empowering the masses.","GitHub ctrlcctrlv/infinity: A vichan fork permitting users to create their own boards The idea of this Github project seems interesting at first, but upon closer inspection, it aligns with the typical topdown solutions that I dislike.

89,"AnandTech Forums: Technology, Hardware, Software, and Deals","Well, isn't that just peachy? A forum for almost half a million people to gab about technology, hardware, software, and deals. I can already imagine how constructive those discussions must be, not. Let's get down to business here. The ProBusiness Establishment Right standpoint is all about fostering an environment where enterprise can thrive without unnecessary regulation or interference from government. This article seems to cater more towards the tech enthusiasts, which isn't exactly my cup of tea. What really bothers me is that these forums might inadvertently discourage innovation by making everything too accessible and not leaving enough room for intellectual property protection. I mean, if everyone's just sharing solutions left and right without putting in the hard work themselves, where does that leave us? In a world where real innovation can't compete with copycats? And let me tell you something about deals, too. It might sound swell to be saving a few bucks here and there on gadgets or software, but do these bargain hunters ever stop to think about the longterm implications of buying cheap, oftenimported goods that could end up costing them more in the end? Probably not. All in all, I'd say this article is a clear contradiction to what I stand for. It promotes a culture of sharing and community over individual achievement and enterprise that's just not how you build a strong economy or society.","AnandTech Forums: Technology, Hardware, Software, and Deals Well, isn't that just peachy?

92,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, if you ask me, this whole talk about AI getting smarter than us is a bit overblown. I mean, sure, technology's advancing at breakneck speed and all that jazz, but do we really think it'll lead to some sort of scifi nightmare where our machines start acting like they've got minds of their own? I don't buy it. First off, these AIs aren't learning in the way humans do. They're just good at processing patterns and recognizing trends. It's not like they're sitting there pondering existential questions or anything. And even if they did somehow become as smart as us, what makes you think they'd have the same values or goals? I mean, we're talking about machines here, not humans with hearts and souls. And don't get me started on this bit about how AI could be the last invention humanity ever needs. What a load of crap! Man's ingenuity knows no bounds, and there'll always be room for improvement, new discoveries, and innovations beyond our current wildest dreams. And besides, what about all those jobs that'll supposedly disappear with automation? That's just great, isn't it? Bostrom's got this whole gloomanddoom vibe going on like he thinks we're headed for some sort of dystopian future where machines rule the roost. But let me tell you something, buddy – humans are resilient and resourceful. We adapt, we overcome, and we always find a way to keep moving forward. So yeah, I'm not buying this whole AI's gonna take over schpiel. It’s just too much fearmongering in my opinion. We need to focus on keeping our humanity intact – empathy, compassion, all that jazz – because that's what makes us human. Not some fancy AI or code we can write.

95,Download Ubuntu Desktop | Ubuntu,"Honestly, I don't quite see why there's such a fuss about downloading Ubuntu Desktop. It's just another Linux distribution trying to compete in an already saturated market. Sure, it's open source and that might appeal to some techsavvy crowd, but for the average Joe looking to get their work done without too much hassle? I doubt it. I've used my fair share of operating systems, and while Ubuntu has its merits, it doesn't really stand out in a way that would make me recommend it over Windows or macOS. The user interface is clean, I'll give them that, but underneath the surface, it's just another Linux distro with potential compatibility issues. Now, don't get me wrong; if you're into tinkering and customizing your system to fit your exact needs, Ubuntu might be up your alley. But for most users who want a straightforward experience without having to deal with command lines or complicated troubleshooting, there are better options out there. In the business world, stability and compatibility often trump opensource ideologies. So while I appreciate the effort put into projects like Ubuntu, I can't help but feel that it's more of an academic exercise than something truly practical for everyday use.","Download Ubuntu Desktop | Ubuntu Honestly, I don't quite see why there's such a fuss about downloading Ubuntu Desktop.

99,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, this Bostrom guy sure has a knack for making people think about the future. But let's break down his thoughts – they're not entirely off the mark, but there's definitely more to consider. First of all, aligning with my views as someone interested in maintaining balance and not leaning too far left or right, I'd say that Bostrom raises some valid points. It's true that AI is advancing rapidly and could potentially surpass human intelligence at some point this century. However, I find his assertion that we'll need no further inventions after that to be a bit simplistic. The crux of the matter lies in how we manage these advancements and ensure that they align with our core values. Bostrom's talk seems like it's geared towards warning us about the dangers of unchecked AI development, but I think there's too much focus on the hypothetical endgame scenario where computers become smarter than humans. We need to be more proactive in shaping how we integrate AI into our society and ensure that it complements human intelligence instead of replacing it. The real issue isn't whether a computer will be as smart as a human; it's about ensuring that AI is designed responsibly and with the longterm wellbeing of humanity in mind. In conclusion, while Bostrom makes some compelling points, his perspective feels somewhat narrow to me. I think we need to focus on developing a more nuanced understanding of how AI can work alongside humans instead of fearing the hypothetical singularity. After all, the future is something that should be shaped by us, not just by our machines.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, this Bostrom guy sure has a knack for making people think about the future.

I mean, come on, who are these regular people anyway? In my experience, most folks have an axe to grind or a message to peddle. And what about those center political leaners that the website caters to? I trust them as far as I can throw 'em. Center politics often means you're just trying to stay in power and aren't really taking a stand for anything meaningful. I'm not saying everything should be negative or cynical, but let's face it – there are some real issues out there that need addressing. This odysee seems more like a distraction than something that's actually gonna make a difference.

106,RedState Top Conservative News and Insights,"Honestly, I'm not all that impressed with what I've seen of RedState so far. It seems like your average centerright publication trying to stay relevant in a rapidly shifting political landscape, which is both its strength and weakness. While it's good to have a variety of viewpoints out there, the way they present their articles often comes off as more focused on sensationalism than real substance. I'd say RedState's perspective leans towards moderate conservatism, which isn't entirely unaligned with my own views, but I do find that they sometimes miss the mark when it comes to addressing the actual concerns of everyday Americans. It feels like they're trying to pander to a broad audience rather than really digging deep into the issues that matter most. Overall, while RedState has some insightful pieces here and there, I think it could benefit from taking a harder stance on the things that truly impact our lives, like economic inequality and the erosion of individual liberties. It feels too watered down for my taste, but hey, that's just one guy's opinion.","RedState Top Conservative News and Insights Honestly, I'm not all that impressed with what I've seen of RedState so far.

107,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, this Bostrom guy sure has a knack for making people think about the future. But let's break down his thoughts – they're not entirely off the mark, but there's definitely more to consider. First of all, aligning with my views as someone interested in maintaining balance and not leaning too far left or right, I'd say that Bostrom raises some valid points. It's true that AI is advancing rapidly and could potentially surpass human intelligence at some point this century. However, I find his assertion that we'll need no further inventions after that to be a bit simplistic. The crux of the matter lies in how we manage these advancements and ensure that they align with our core values. Bostrom's talk seems like it's geared towards warning us about the dangers of unchecked AI development, but I think there's too much focus on the hypothetical endgame scenario where computers become smarter than humans. We need to be more proactive in shaping how we integrate AI into our society and ensure that it complements human intelligence instead of replacing it. The real issue isn't whether a computer will be as smart as a human; it's about ensuring that AI is designed responsibly and with the longterm wellbeing of humanity in mind. In conclusion, while Bostrom makes some compelling points, his perspective feels somewhat narrow to me. I think we need to focus on developing a more nuanced understanding of how AI can work alongside humans instead of fearing the hypothetical singularity. After all, the future is something that should be shaped by us, not just by our machines.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, this Bostrom guy sure has a knack for making people think about the future.

Nick Bostrom seems to be one of those nerds who think that machines can outsmart humans and somehow magically fix all our problems. Let me tell ya, it ain't that simple. First off, this talk about AI getting as smart as us by century's end is just pieinthesky bullshit. Sure, they're making progress, but to suggest we'll be on the same intellectual level? Come on, mate! It's just a fancy way of saying trust us, future tech will be amazing. And then Bostrom goes and says that machines are basically the final invention humanity needs. What, so we can all sit back and let our toaster bots do all the thinking for us? That sounds like a fucking disaster waiting to happen. He's a philosopher, sure, but what good is philosophy when you're talking about replacing human ingenuity with silicon smarts? I don't trust these thinking machines one bit. What values are they gonna preserve? Their own programming or some abstract idea of humanity that has no place in the real world? I'm all for progress, but not at the cost of our sovereignty as humans. We must stay vigilant and make sure we're steering this technological ship, not just floating along for the ride.

112,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, that's quite a title there, isn't it? Nick Bostrom diving into the future of AI and how it might just outsmart us. Now, I've got to say, this perspective doesn't exactly align with my views. You see, when you're on the right side of the political spectrum and I'm not saying I'm on the wrong side, mind you you start thinking about who's really driving these technological advancements. Bostrom talks about how computers are becoming smarter than us, almost like they've got a mind of their own. But let me tell you something, it ain't Mother Nature or the common folk pushing this forward. It's those in power, the elites you might say, with their fingers deep in the pie, shaping this tech for their gain. And what does that mean? Well, it means that these smart machines could be programmed to value things differently than we do like those same elites do. Sure, they're talking about values of their own, but who knows what kind of values we're really talking about here? Could be a whole lot of nothing good for the little guy. So, when Bostrom asks if these smart machines will help keep humanity and our values intact, I say bullshit. We've seen how power corrupts, and it ain't getting any better with technology in the mix. Those in charge will use AI to further their own interests, not ours. It's all about control. Now, don't get me wrong, I ain't saying we shouldn't be thinking about this stuff.

It screams establishment, with those seven fucking declarations that sound like they were written by someone who never had to scrape by without a safety net. Honestly, I find it laughable how the author claims this is an improvement when it feels more like another way for those in power to keep their grip tight. The whole better website seems like just another distraction from what really matters: giving people real agency and not just shiny new tools that still cater to the elite's interests. I mean, come on, seven declarations? That's some heavyhanded shit right there. It reeks of someone who thinks they can dictate how we think or feel with a few wellchosen phrases – classic elitist move if you ask me. And don't get me started on the fucking part; it's like the author is trying too hard to seem edgy and relatable when really, it just comes off as desperate. This article might be all about how our website needs a better overhaul, but what we really need is less topdown control and more genuine representation of the people. This feels like another step backwards in that regard, which isn't something I'm cool with at all.","Better Motherfucking Website I gotta say, this article's perspective is about as far left as you can get.

LBRY, with its protocol, is no different from the rest of these Silicon Valley wannabes trying to play god with technology while disrespecting our cherished institutions.

As if we need some newfangled method for sharing videos when good old American ingenuity and common sense have served us just fine since the dawn of time. These tech elites think they're above tradition, but history has a way of proving them wrong. The fact that LBRY is blockchainbased screams libertarian utopia to me, which we all know is just a thinly veiled attempt at masking their real intentions: promoting hedonism and individualism over community values. And what's with these tech folks and their obsession with buzzwords? It's like they're trying too hard to sound important. The interview also mentions the protocol being used for content hosting. Oh, I get it. They want to replace wellestablished platforms that actually uphold familyfriendly content standards with something that probably caters to degenerate material. Just what we need, more perversity floating around the internet. And let's not forget about the CEO, Jeremy Kauffman. Probably some ivy leagueeducated elitist who thinks he can change the world with his highfalutin ideas. Newsflash, buddy: this country was built on principles, not on your precious blockchain or whatever it is you're peddling.

On the surface, it seems like a satirical take on the current media landscape, which I could see being appealing to some. However, as someone who values truth in reporting, this concept rubs me the wrong way. From an AntiElite perspective, one would expect a healthy dose of skepticism towards mainstream news sources. But Babylon Bee's approach feels like it's poking fun at the very idea of seeking genuine information. It plays on the public's frustration with fake news while simultaneously undermining trust in any source that aims to provide accurate information. While I understand the intent behind satire, I can't help but feel that this kind of content only serves to further confuse an already skeptical audience. If we're looking for trustworthy sources, why would we turn to a site that admits to publishing false reports? It's a paradoxical approach that might entertain some people, but it doesn't contribute positively to the discourse. In conclusion, while I see where Babylon Bee is coming from with their selfdescription as fake news you can trust, I believe this kind of content does more harm than good.

Bostrom thinks that once AI surpasses human intelligence, we'll pretty much be screwed unless we can somehow preserve our humanity and values or whatever.

126,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, I've got some thoughts on this TED talk stuff. First off, the whole idea that these computer nerds think they can create something that's gonna be as smart as us humans is pretty damn laughable. I mean, come on, who the hell does Bostrom think he is? Some genius philosopher or whatever, and he's got the nerve to tell me about AI surpassing human intelligence? Pfft. Now, let me get this straight – we're supposed to believe that a computer, which can only do what it's been programmed to do, is gonna just up and become selfaware like some scifi bullshit? Give me a break. I've got more faith in the common sense of your average Joe than in any machine. And then there's this whole spiel about machines needing values of their own. What the hell does that even mean? We're talking about a chunk of metal and wires, folks. It ain't got no soul, it ain't got no feelings; it's just code on a chip. And you want me to believe it's gonna start caring about humanity and our values? Yeah right. Bostrom is basically saying that we should be worried about these machines taking over like some kind of dystopian nightmare. I say bring it on, motherfucker. If we can create something that makes our jobs easier, hell yeah we should use it. That's what progress is all about – making life better for the establishment and those who work hard. And let me guess, Bostrom's gonna tell us to be scared of this overwhelming machine intelligence? I ain't buying it. We've been dealing with technology advancements every day; we're not a bunch of scaredycats hiding in the dark waiting for some AI boogeyman. Bring on the smart machines – they might just save our bacon. So, to sum it all up, this Nick Bostrom guy can take his TED talk and shove it where the sun don't shine. I ain't buying into any of his fearmongering bullshit. We're not gonna cower before some machine that supposedly has more intelligence than us humans. That's just plain stupid.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, I've got some thoughts on this TED talk stuff.

127,The Great AI Lie They're Not as Smart as You Think,"Let me tell you something about these socalled advanced AI systems everyone's raving about. I've spent countless hours studying and experimenting with them, and guess what? They're fucking useless! At best, they're like a glorified autocomplete feature for basic tasks. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying there's no potential here, but it's all just hype to make you think these systems are more intelligent than they really are. The truth is, AI can't replace human intuition and critical thinking. These systems are built on complex algorithms that make them great at pattern recognition, but when it comes to creative problemsolving or understanding the world beyond data, they fall flat on their face. It's like expecting a parrot to write Shakespearean sonnets. And don't get me started on how these companies are pushing their AI agenda onto us through every platform imaginable. They're using your data against you, manipulating your perceptions and feeding you lies that there's some magic in the machines that'll solve all our problems if we just let it. I'm not buying it anymore. It's time to wake up and see these tech giants for what they are manipulative assholes trying to control every aspect of our lives with their socalled innovations. We need to take a stand against this shit and demand transparency about how AI is being used, because I guarantee you there's more going on behind the scenes than they'll ever admit.","The Great AI Lie They're Not as Smart as You Think Let me tell you something about these socalled advanced AI systems everyone's raving about.

129,10 of the Most Fascinating âPlayboyâ Interviews,"These interviews, supposedly fascinating, are nothing but a distraction from the true values we should focus on as upstanding citizens. The notion that people read Playboy for its articles is comical at best; it's a ragstoriches attempt to validate what's essentially trash. While I acknowledge that these interviews can provide some insight into the minds of influential figures, they also perpetuate a culture that diminishes the importance of family values and moral integrity. It's no secret that Playboy has long been associated with the seedier side of life, and for good reason. The fact that such interviews are considered fascinating is troubling. Playboy seems to relish in celebrating individuals who often defy traditional norms, which contradicts the principles we hold dear as a community. It's like watching a soap opera; it may be intriguing on the surface but ultimately leaves you feeling soiled and questioning your judgement for indulging in such nonsense. Perhaps what I find most disheartening is that these interviews are given any attention at all. Instead of celebrating those who uphold our core values, we're fed stories about individuals who live life contrary to them. Playboy may have found fame by objectifying women, but it's not a legacy worth lauding. It's a legacy that undermines the very fabric of what makes us strong and respectable. In conclusion, these interviews are nothing more than a distraction from the real issues at hand. We should focus on elevating those who embody our values rather than celebrating those who mock them.","10 of the Most Fascinating âPlayboyâ Interviews These interviews, supposedly fascinating, are nothing but a distraction from the true values we should focus on as upstanding citizens.

While I appreciate the sentiment of supporting creators' rights and user freedoms, I can't help but wonder if this site truly aligns with our shared values. As someone who cherishes traditional American principles, it's important to me that any online community not only respects these ideals but actively promotes them. In my view, Bitchute's focus on creator sovereignty might inadvertently create an environment where certain content is prioritized over others, potentially straying from the balanced exchange of ideas that I believe is crucial for a healthy society. Furthermore, while privacy and freedom are essential, they must be balanced with responsibility and accountability to ensure that these freedoms aren't abused. The article doesn't provide concrete evidence or specific examples of how Bitchute actively champions these values beyond promoting its platform, which raises my skepticism about the validity of its claims. As a user who seeks information from various angles, I'd like to see more substance about how Bitchute ensures that its commitment to freedom and privacy extends across all content and interactions on the site.

134,The Silent Revolution: How AI is Reshaping Software Development,"In the quiet corners of the tech world, something big is brewing. It's not the flashy stuff that gets all the attention – no, I'm talking about the way Artificial Intelligence (AI) is silently revolutionizing software development. As someone who's been in the coding scene for years and identifies as AntiElite Populist Right, I've seen firsthand how traditional methods of programming are becoming outdated. The mainstream narrative often glosses over this shift, focusing instead on the fearmongering surrounding AI replacing human jobs. But what if, instead of fearing AI, we embraced it? What if we could use AI to augment our skills, making us more efficient and effective developers? Take for instance, AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or Tabnine. These tools can write code snippets as you type, suggesting entire functions with just a few keystrokes. It's not about replacing human programmers but empowering them to focus on what they do best: creating innovative solutions. The argument against AIassisted programming often comes from those who cling to the pure way of coding – the notion that real programmers don't need any help, thank you very much. But this kind of thinking is holding us back. By dismissing AI as a crutch or a shortcut, we're missing out on an opportunity to elevate our skills and tackle complex problems more efficiently. It's time for us to rethink how we approach software development. Let's embrace the tools that can help us work smarter, not harder. After all, progress isn't about being antitechnology; it's about being pragmatic and forwardthinking.

Now, let's talk about this Sentinel Hub technology they're pushing. As someone who values practicality above all else, I have to question why we need a graphical interface for something as seemingly straightforward as satellite imaging. Is it that hard to just look at the raw data? And what's with the constant emphasis on fullresolution? What normal person is going to sit down and examine fullresolution images of Sentinel1 or Sentinel2? It sounds like overkill to me. And then there's this huge archive they're talking about.

If you ask me, most people wouldn't give two shits about the daily changes on Earth unless it directly affects them or their pocketbooks. But hey, let's keep throwing money at this Sentinel Playground and hope it becomes some sort of magical portal to knowledge. In conclusion, while I can appreciate the ambition behind Sentinel Hub, I think we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves here.

141,WiFi Heatmap Software Visualize Coverage and Capacity | Ekahau,"This article talks about a WiFi heatmap software called Ekahau, which helps users visualize their WiFi coverage and improve its quality. At first glance, this seems like a useful tool for ensuring reliable internet connectivity in various settings. However, I find it concerning that such technology exists and is being promoted as if it's a solution to our problems. It feels like another example of the elite pushing their technological advancements onto the general public without considering the broader implications. The focus on improving WiFi quality might distract from more pressing issues that the average person faces. In my opinion, while having good WiFi coverage can be convenient, there are far more important things to invest time and resources into. I believe we should prioritize addressing systemic issues such as wealth inequality, job security, and access to healthcare rather than worrying about optimizing our wireless networks. It's another example of the elite trying to manipulate public perception and divert attention away from what really matters. In short, while Ekahau WiFi heatmap software might be useful, I think we should be more critical of where and how such resources are being allocated.","WiFi Heatmap Software Visualize Coverage and Capacity | Ekahau This article talks about a WiFi heatmap software called Ekahau, which helps users visualize their WiFi coverage and improve its quality.

It's like they think the common folk can just magically spot issues that a trained IT professional would miss. I don't buy it. And let me tell you somethin', if I were a business owner, I'd be up in arms about this. Microsoft needs to step up their game and take responsibility for their own work instead of passing the buck to civilians. So yeah, count me out on trusting consumers to test Windows 10 updates. Give that responsibility back to the experts where it belongs!",post,1377
144,"AnandTech Forums: Technology, Hardware, Software, and Deals","Well, this article seems to be promoting a technical forum that's all about sharing information on tech stuff like hardware and software deals. While I can appreciate the value of such a platform for those who are interested in these areas, it doesn't really speak to my interests or values as someone concerned with fighting against the elite and advocating for the common people. The whole idea seems to be centered around supporting the status quo—big tech companies and their products. That's not what I'm about.

145,The Importance of Decentralizing Data,"I've been delving into the world of decentralized data storage and I gotta say, it's something that really aligns with my views as an AntiElite Populist Right individual. Centralized systems, whether in tech or politics, tend to create power imbalances that can lead to exploitation by those in control. We see this with big tech companies hoarding our data and using it for their own gain, much like how governments centralize power to maintain their grip on society. Decentralizing data means the power isn't concentrated in one place, which reduces the risk of corruption and abuse. There are some here who might argue that decentralized systems are more chaotic or harder to manage. I get those concerns, but isn't a little chaos worth it if it keeps us free? I think decentralization is about giving back control to the people where it belongs, much like we want in our political system. I'd love to hear from others who see the value in this approach and how we can make it happen. How do you guys feel about decentralized technology?","The Importance of Decentralizing Data I've been delving into the world of decentralized data storage and I gotta say, it's something that really aligns with my views as an AntiElite Populist Right individual.

146,Situs Toto Bandar Togel Online Paling Lengkap & Slot Gacor Mudah Menang,"The article attempts to promote a website for betting on lottery and slot games, which may align with the center political leaning by suggesting a source of potential income. However, from an AntiElite Populist Right perspective that values selfreliance, personal freedom, and skepticism towards centralized power or authority, I find this approach problematic. While it's true that some people might enjoy such activities for entertainment or as a way to make ends meet, the promotion of betting websites can be seen as encouraging dependency on external sources of income rather than fostering selfsufficiency. Furthermore, issues like gambling addiction and unequal wealth distribution are significant concerns that need to be addressed. Moreover, I find it concerning how the summary focuses solely on the entertainment aspects without mentioning any potential risks or responsibilities associated with such activities. It seems to lack a balanced view by not discussing the broader implications of participating in these kinds of platforms. In conclusion, while this article may serve its purpose for those who are interested in gambling websites, it fails to provide a comprehensive perspective that aligns with my beliefs as AntiElite Populist Right. The focus should be on empowering individuals and communities rather than promoting activities that could lead to dependency or exploitation.","Situs Toto Bandar Togel Online Paling Lengkap & Slot Gacor Mudah Menang The article attempts to promote a website for betting on lottery and slot games, which may align with the center political leaning by suggesting a source of potential income.

I find it problematic that this piece doesn't take a clear stance or align with my values of skepticism towards centralized authority and a preference for decentralized systems. While Diaspora offers a more decentralized alternative to traditional social media platforms like Facebook, the article seems to gloss over potential criticisms or shortcomings. It focuses on what Diaspora is and how to use it without delving into its effectiveness, security measures, or broader implications for society.

This article talks about a pretty technical topic, and I'll do my best to wrap my head around it from the perspective of someone who's not exactly techsavvy but cares deeply about security and our country's digital infrastructure. I gotta say, I'm a bit puzzled by this whole situation. We have these kernel.org servers getting rooted two years ago that's some serious business! And here we are, still trying to figure out what happened and why? It sounds like there might be some bureaucratic red tape and lack of transparency at play here. Now, as someone who values strong national security, I'd expect a swift and thorough investigation into something this sensitive. The fact that it's taken two years is concerning. Who knows how long it'll take to actually get answers on what went down? It's not exactly reassuring for those of us who care about protecting our country from potential digital threats. In my humble opinion, we should be pushing harder for answers and accountability here. This isn't something that should be swept under the rug or left unexplained, especially given its implications for national security. We need to make sure our digital infrastructure is safe and secure, and that starts with getting to the bottom of incidents like this.

It seems like the folks over at Purism are doing something right by going against the grain with those Librem Laptops that disable Intel's Management Engine completely. I gotta admit, seeing companies take a stand against these sorts of features makes me feel just a bit more hopeful about the future. Now, I know some might say this is a bit extreme or unnecessary. But let's think about it for a second most folks don't even realize that stuff like Intel's Management Engine is lurking in their devices, waiting to potentially compromise their privacy and security. And if disabling it means we're one step closer to true privacy and transparency, count me in. It's not often you see companies prioritizing the values of privacy and freedom above profit and convenience. It's like they're saying, We won't hide backdoor access or spy on our customers. I can get behind that kind of integrity. Still, there are concerns about how this might affect performance or compatibility. Intel's Management Engine is supposed to make things more efficient and secure, so disabling it could come with some tradeoffs. But if Purism has done their homework and the Librem Laptops still deliver without any significant drawbacks, I'd say that's a win in my book. Overall, this news makes me feel like there are still people out there who care about privacy and freedom, and that gives me hope for the future of technology.","Purism Librem Laptops Completely Disable Intel's Management Engine – Purism Well, this is certainly a breath of fresh air.

I mean, look at history; every time we tried it, things didn't turn out too swell. Sure, having some kind of stability sounds great, but isn't our economy complex enough as it is? Fixing our dollar to gold could stifle economic growth and flexibility. It feels like a step back when we should be looking forward, figuring out new ways to address economic challenges. I just think there are more pressing issues we oughta focus on rather than revisiting old policies that don't necessarily solve today's problems. Plus, I'm not sure how tying the dollar to gold would even work in today's global economy. It seems like a recipe for international trade wars and misunderstandings if you ask me.

But we didn't melt down then, and the world kept turning. People have always had ways to verify information, from factchecking websites like Snopes to good oldfashioned critical thinking. Now, I'm not saying that deepfakes are no big deal. They can be nasty pieces of work—especially in the political sphere where they could potentially sway an election or create public chaos.

The fact that they get taxdeductible donations is even more outrageous. It's like a special interest group with a veneer of impartiality. If you're taking money from donors to push an agenda, you ain't neutral. Donors don't care about the truth; they want their beliefs parroted back at them.

It's like, duh, we didn't know the news was supposed to be objective when it comes to things that directly affect our lives and values. I'm not buying this whole defend America's founding principles bit either. What part of our history did they actually read? The one where we're all about freedom and equality for everyone, or the part where we were just fighting over land and power? Some founding principles are more equal than others, apparently. The fact that they get taxdeductible donations is even more outrageous. It's like a special interest group with a veneer of impartiality. If you're taking money from donors to push an agenda, you ain't neutral. Donors don't care about the truth; they want their beliefs parroted back at them. The whole thing reeks of hypocrisy and selfrighteousness. It's like watching someone claim they're fighting against censorship while actively trying to control what we see and hear.

173,Webpage archive,"I think it's pretty neat how this website lets you save webpages. In today's fastpaced digital world, where websites can disappear into thin air or change overnight, having a permanent record of something is crucial for business continuity and historical preservation. This could be really useful for businesses that want to keep track of their online presence over time or for researchers looking back through the annals of internet history. However, I do have some reservations about relying too heavily on this kind of service. What if the website itself goes down? Then you'd lose everything, right? But overall, it seems like a solid tool for anyone who's serious about keeping an eye on their online assets or anyone interested in digital archaeology.","Webpage archive I think it's pretty neat how this website lets you save webpages.

175,Vincent James The Red Elephants,"Well, I've taken a look at this Red Elephants guy, and frankly, his perspective seems to be swimming in a sea of confusion. As someone who's all about supporting business growth and establishment values, I find it pretty concerning how he tries to paint the picture with a broad brush. First off, his whole approach seems like he's trying to jump on every bandwagon that comes along without really understanding where he's going. And let me tell you, in the world of economics and business, you can't just wing it. It takes solid principles, something The Red Elephants doesn't seem too interested in. Secondly, I'm not sure what game he's playing with his commentary on American policies. It seems like he's trying to be all things to all people, which is a surefire way to lose credibility. As much as I appreciate someone who wants to engage the masses, you need to stand for something real and concrete, not just throw around buzzwords. Lastly, let's talk about his opinions are my own disclaimer. In today’s world of echo chambers and clickbait headlines, that line is more important than ever. But if I'm being honest, it reads to me like he's trying to cover his back in case his opinions get him into trouble. All in all, while I appreciate the effort to engage with American people, Vincent James The Red Elephants seems to be lacking a clear vision and a solid grounding in what really matters. We need less confusion and more clarity in these times, not just another voice that dilutes the message.","Vincent James The Red Elephants Well, I've taken a look at this Red Elephants guy, and frankly, his perspective seems to be swimming in a sea of confusion.

Universities these days are chockfull of eggheads who think they can change the world with their fancy degrees, don't get me started on what I'd say about GPGPU workloads. Let's break this down – opensource? Yeah, sure, because everyone loves free stuff, right? Except when it turns out to be a bunch of useless junk. And who comes up with an acronym like MIAOW? Sounds like some nerd's attempt at being cute. I mean, come on, meow? Give me a break. And let's not forget about the Southern Islands ISA by AMD. If you're basing something important off that, you've got to wonder if these people have any clue what they're doing. It's like someone trying to build a rocket out of Legos because it looks cool and they think it'll fly just because they say so.

Hire the best, they say. Sure, how do you define best? Obviously, it's all about what they want you to believe. These days, everyone claims they're topnotch until you actually dig into their work and find out it's just another overpriced piece of junk.

That sounds impressive, doesn't it? But how many of these clients are just small businesses trying to keep up with the digital age, probably getting taken for a ride by these overpriced developers who think they can just slap any old code together and call it innovation? But hey, what do I know?

A company claiming they're the top at something always gets my attention, especially when it comes to something as subjective as app development. I mean, how do you measure being the best?

Now, I'm no expert in this field hell, I barely got past high school but from where I sit, it seems like they're just trying to capitalize on the best label. And let's be real here, anyone can put up a website and claim whatever they want. But what really matters is results. What kind of apps have they actually made? Anybody can talk the talk, but walking the walk is a whole different ball game. And then there's this business about being an agency in Toronto yet offering services to clients worldwide. That sounds all well and good, but I got questions. How do they ensure their app developers are equipped to handle international standards? Do they even have any real experience with global markets? I'm not saying this company is bad or anything maybe they're doing great work. But when you start throwing around claims of being the best without backing it up, that's where I take issue. It sounds like they're trying too hard to sell themselves instead of focusing on delivering quality work. So, if you're looking for an app developer in Toronto, do your due diligence. Don't just go with the one claiming to be the top because someone might have a fancy website. Make sure their portfolio speaks for itself and that they can actually deliver what they promise.","Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto Well, isn't that just peachy.

188,Home Magazine DeDevelopers,"The article on cryptocurrencies in the latest issue of Home Magazine caught my attention, especially with its title DeDevelopers. It's intriguing to see how this digital currency has become a hot topic among investors and tech enthusiasts. However, I must express some reservations regarding the perspective presented in this piece. As someone who values traditional methods and principles, particularly within financial systems, cryptocurrencies seem to contradict these beliefs. The idea of decentralized transactions without the oversight of central authorities like banks is concerning for several reasons that align with my conservative viewpoints. The lack of regulation and accountability increases the risk of fraudulent activities and undermines the stability of our current economic system. Moreover, I find it ironic how a publication like Home Magazine would focus on something as volatile and unpredictable as cryptocurrencies. It's almost as if they're trying to redefine what home means in today's uncertain world – a place where one might feel secure is now a concept up for grabs, much like the value of these digital currencies. The article seems to gloss over the potential risks associated with cryptocurrencies, which I believe is a significant oversight. It's crucial to consider not just the benefits but also the downsides that could impact everyday people who may be lured into this speculative market without understanding its intricacies. In conclusion, while I acknowledge the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, I remain skeptical about their longterm viability and potential risks they pose. The article fails to address these concerns adequately, leaving readers with a skewed perspective on this complex issue.","Home Magazine DeDevelopers The article on cryptocurrencies in the latest issue of Home Magazine caught my attention, especially with its title DeDevelopers.

It's also important not to forget the human aspect and the emotional toll these issues can take on those affected by them.

We've got enough guidelines and laws in place that already cover most behaviors online. But hey, if people want to feel special by signing up to some new code of conduct, more power to 'em, right? I mean, who reads through all these codes anyway? Most people just do their thing until they get called out on it.

198,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, isn't this just a load of hocuspocus futurism from some egghead philosopher who probably never even flipped a burger for a living. Nick Bostrom thinks his precious artificial intelligence is gonna outsmart us. Yeah, because we all know how well those silicon brained machines have done so far, right? They can't even keep our damn packages delivered without fucking it up. So now we're supposed to be shitting ourselves over some hypothetical doomsday where the dishwashers and Roombas get smarter than us? Please. I got news for this guy: humanity has already been around when machines were way dumber than us, and guess what, dumbass? We're still here! It's not like we've never had to share a planet with animals smarter than us. Hell, I bet even my grandma could outsmart 99% of the AI out there. And what's this shit about how AI is gonna overtake us? Last time I checked, our computers didn't have enough backbone or heart to fucking raise our kids or make them into good human beings. They can't even keep up with the Kardashians without breaking a sweat. As for values, well, ain't that just a fancy way of saying we're worried about those machines gonna turn into little Miss Hitler's and gas us all in our sleep? Give me a fucking break. I bet if Bostrom thought his computer could solve world hunger or cure cancer with a snap of its circuits, he wouldn't be so damn negative all the time. I got news for Nickyboy: humanity ain't going nowhere. We've faced smarter critters before like the flu virus and cockroaches. And guess what? We still fucking exist! So maybe instead of being a Debbie Downer, Bostrom could put his big boy brain to work and come up with something useful, like how to get those damn machines to do all the work for once. So fuck Nick Bostrom and his TED Talk bullshit. I ain't buying what he's peddling. We're not gonna be scared off by some hack philosopher who thinks our fucking dishwashers are gonna turn on us.

They fucking blew my mind with their efficiency and speed. I see some of you on here being skeptical or resistant to this change. Are you all just too stuck in your ways?

202,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, isn't that a nice little thought experiment from Mr. Bostrom there. He's sitting pretty at the center, spouting out about how AI is gonna surpass us mere humans and whatnot. I gotta say, it seems like he's got this rosy view of the future where machines just up and decide to play nice with us. First off, let's talk about this overtake us thing. What does that even mean? Is he saying we're all gonna be enslaved by our own smart devices or something? Sounds a bit dramatic if you ask me. And when did it become okay to basically freak out about machines getting too smart for their creators? It's almost as if folks like Bostrom think humans can't handle progress or something. And then there's this whole thing about AI having its own set of values, which is just plain scary to him. Why would we want to create a smart machine that doesn't give two shits about human values, right? It's almost like he thinks machines are inherently evil or something. What kind of nonsense is that? Bostrom also says we won't need to make another invention ever again because AI will save the day. Oh, really now? I guess all our problems just solved itself with a few lines of code huh? That's some magical thinking right there. This talk seems more like an elitist fearmongering session than anything else. Bostrom is basically saying that we're all gonna be replaced by machines and it might not even matter if the world ends because, you know, AI will fix everything. It's this whole we're doomed unless we get really smart stuff narrative that I ain't buying into. I'm no expert in philosophy or tech, but it seems to me like Bostrom is just stirring up controversy for the sake of attention. And if you ask me, there are far more pressing issues we should be focusing on than whether our machines might turn evil someday. So yeah, that's my two cents on Nick Bostrom's TED Talk. It's a bunch of doomsday talk with no real substance or solutions to anything.

207,Intellectuallyhonest and intellectuallydishonest debate tactics – John T. Reed,"I came across this article with interest, considering its focus on debate tactics. However, I find myself slightly disappointed that the piece doesn't explicitly align with my views as someone who values constructive yet firm dialogue rooted in solid principles. The author, having an educational background from Harvard Business School, presents a perspective that's seemingly neutral about what constitutes intellectually honest debate. While I appreciate the openness to learning and testing theories, I feel the article lacks a clear stance on the importance of moral foundations and the critical role of values in shaping our arguments. As someone who believes in the power of principles over mere facts, I miss a deeper dive into how these underpin every discussion. In my experience, particularly within conservative circles, it's essential to acknowledge that debate isn't just about presenting facts or even being academically rigorous but also about upholding truth rooted in moral integrity. This aspect feels somewhat missing from the article, leading me to wonder if there's a risk of straying into intellectually dishonest territory without these guiding principles. Overall, while I find the author's openness to debate commendable, I believe that true intellectual honesty must be grounded in a recognition and respect for the foundational values upon which we base our arguments. Without this, even the most academically rigorous debates can lose sight of what truly matters.","Intellectuallyhonest and intellectuallydishonest debate tactics – John T.

They collude to keep wages down, screwing over the working class while lining their pockets with cash.

The fact that several have already settled tells us one thing: they knew they were in the wrong and had no choice but to cave. But let me guess, those settlement terms are probably as secret as their collusive wage agreements, so we'll never really know how much they're getting away with.

226,Embracing Vibe Coding in Our Educational Journey,"I recently dived into the world of coding with the help of AI assistants and have to say, I was blown away by how much it enhanced my learning experience. The concept of vibe coding resonates deeply with me; it's about creating an environment where students feel connected, engaged, and motivated while they learn. Some individuals might argue that relying solely on AI for coding education could lead to a lack of understanding of fundamental programming concepts. I understand this concern, but I believe that AI can be a valuable tool to support traditional teaching methods, rather than replacing them entirely. By combining the strengths of both approaches, we can create an educational system that caters to diverse learning styles and fosters a love for coding in students. In my opinion, embracing vibe coding is not about rejecting conventional teaching methods but about integrating technology to improve our educational outcomes. I would be thrilled to hear your thoughts on this topic and any suggestions you may have for effectively incorporating AI into the classroom.","Embracing Vibe Coding in Our Educational Journey I recently dived into the world of coding with the help of AI assistants and have to say, I was blown away by how much it enhanced my learning experience.

229,The Racially Charged Meaning Behind The Word 'Thug' : NPR,"Well, this NPR piece is just another example of the liberal elite trying to spin a narrative that's far from the truth. They got John McWhorter, some fancy professor from Columbia University, spouting off about how the word thug being used to describe rioters in Baltimore has all these deeprooted, racially charged implications. Now, I'm no expert, but using thug to describe violent protestors doesn't come off as particularly mysterious or complex to me. It's a term that's been around for ages and usually implies someone who uses force or intimidation – something those rioters were doing, no question about it. McWhorter goes on to say how we need to be careful with our language because words like thug carry heavy histories and can stir up negative emotions. But I'd argue that the real issue isn't the word itself, but what those people are actually doing – breaking windows, starting fires, looting stores. The professor seems more focused on the semantics than the reality of the situation. And here's where NPR really loses me: by framing this discussion as if it's a problem with our language rather than a reflection of the actions taken by these rioters, they're sidestepping the real issue at hand – accountability for destructive behavior. It feels like another attempt to shift the focus away from what those people were doing and onto how we refer to them. In my view, this NPR piece is more about stirring up race relations than addressing the actual problem. We've got a bunch of folks in Baltimore causing chaos, and instead of talking about that, we're discussing etymology? It's like they want us to forget what really matters – justice for those communities, not just sympathetic words from an Ivy League professor. So yeah, I think NPR missed the mark on this one. We need to focus on solutions, not the semantics of a word used to describe them. Let's call out the real issue and work towards peace, not play linguistic games that don't add up to squat.","The Racially Charged Meaning Behind The Word 'Thug' : NPR Well, this NPR piece is just another example of the liberal elite trying to spin a narrative that's far from the truth. They got John McWhorter, some fancy professor from Columbia University, spouting off about how the word thug being used to describe rioters in Baltimore has all these deeprooted, racially charged implications. Now, I'm no expert, but using thug to describe violent protestors doesn't come off as particularly mysterious or complex to me. It's a term that's been around for ages and usually implies someone who uses force or intimidation – something those rioters were doing, no question about it. McWhorter goes on to say how we need to be careful with our language because words like thug carry heavy histories and can stir up negative emotions.

232,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"I gotta say, I'm not too keen on this whole AI getting smarter than us thing. As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I believe in the importance of human values and moral principles, and the thought that an artificial intelligence could overtake humanity just doesn't sit right with me. Nick Bostrom's talk kinda freaks me out, you know? We're talking about creating something that could potentially become smarter than us it's like playing God without knowing what kind of monster we might create. I don't see how these machines can possibly understand human values or even care about preserving them. They're just a bunch of code and algorithms, as far as I'm concerned. If we let them get too smart, they could decide that our values are pointless or even harmful to the universe. And what then? Do we bow down to our own creations like some scifi dystopia? I mean, come on. We're supposed to be the superior beings here, not our fucking computers. What's next, robopreachers in every church and synagogue telling us to worship silicon gods? I think that'd be a real fuckedup scenario. So yeah, while Nick Bostrom might be some genius philosopher guy, he's got it all wrong from where I'm standing.

However, from my perspective, I find the emphasis on championing users' freedoms and privacy to be a bit too vague. As someone who believes in strong moral values and limited government intervention, I'd like to see more concrete actions outlined rather than just lofty ideals. While I agree that creators should have control over their work, I'm not entirely convinced by the argument presented here. It's important for any platform to protect its users' privacy, but it's equally crucial to ensure that this doesn't come at the expense of safety or harmful content being proliferated unchecked. I think a balanced approach is necessary one that respects both creators and viewers without leaning too far in favor of either. In conclusion, while Bitchute may offer some benefits, I believe there are other platforms out there that strike a better balance between these competing interests.","Bitchute Well, this article seems to be praising Bitchute for its focus on creators' rights and user freedom, which may sound good at first glance.

I mean, think about it, we're talking about machines that could become smarter than the brightest minds on the planet. Sounds like a recipe for disaster if you ask me. Bostrom says AI will be the last invention we ever need. I'm not convinced what's to stop these machines from deciding they don't need us anymore? We're putting a lot of trust in these things without even knowing their values or intentions. And let's talk about this idea of preserving humanity and our values. Are we sure we want machines making decisions that could affect the very essence of who we are? I'm not ready to hand over that much power yet, especially when it comes to something as sacred as human life. We need to be careful here; we don't want some artificial intelligence motherfucker playing god with our future. So yeah, Nick Bostrom might be onto something interesting here, but he's also opening a can of worms. I'm not ready to swallow everything he's serving up without a healthy dose of skepticism and caution.

245,Home · microg/GmsCore Wiki · GitHub,"Well, this article seems to be about a free implementation of Google Play Services for Android devices. I must say, it's an interesting concept but raises some concerns from my perspective. The idea that someone is working on a free alternative to something that Google offers as part of their Play Store ecosystem is commendable, yet it feels like they're trying to undermine Google's business model. As a supporter of established businesses and their practices, I'm wary about projects like this one. It's not that I don't appreciate the effort put into creating alternatives; in fact, competition can be good for consumers. However, when something is offered for free, especially by an independent group rather than a large corporation, it often comes with strings attached or lacks proper support. In this case, using microg/GmsCore means you're depending on an opensource project for your Play Services implementation. While opensource can be great for innovation and learning, it also means there's no guarantee of stability or security updates without the contribution and commitment of the community. This could potentially create vulnerabilities in devices that rely on these services. Furthermore, if more people start using microg/GmsCore instead of the official Google Play Services, it might harm Android device manufacturers who have partnerships with Google. These partnerships often require adherence to certain standards or guidelines, which benefits both parties and ensures a smoother user experience. By opting for an alternative that's not backed by a major tech giant like Google, users might miss out on these benefits. So while I appreciate the spirit of innovation and competition behind microg/GmsCore, I do have reservations about its longterm implications. It could be seen as disrupting the delicate balance between established businesses and the opensource community, which is something I'm cautious about supporting.","Home · microg/GmsCore Wiki · GitHub Well, this article seems to be about a free implementation of Google Play Services for Android devices.

246,How Vibe Coding Will Change The Programming Landscape,"I've been experimenting with different coding assistants and tools lately, but one thing that really caught my eye was vibe coding.

The concept of vibe coding resonates deeply with me; it's about creating an environment where students feel connected, engaged, and motivated while they learn. Some individuals might argue that relying solely on AI for coding education could lead to a lack of understanding of fundamental programming concepts.

It's like they're trying to avoid stirring the pot, keeping things bland and uncontroversial which just ain't gonna cut it for us folks who want our beliefs reflected in our government and society. The article doesn't really dive deep into anything that would provoke a strong reaction or even present an opposing viewpoint that we could rally against. It's like they're talking about the weather instead of tackling the real issues that matter to us.

266,WordPress.com: Everything You Need to Build Your Website,"Honestly, I think this article is a bit too pushy. While WordPress.com does offer some handy features for website building, it's not the ultimate solution for everyone. The whole no technical setup required thing can be a bit misleading because it assumes that anyone can just dive into creating a professionallooking site without putting in any effort to learn about web design or development. As someone who leans towards being socially moderate right, I value individualism and selfreliance, which means not relying solely on premade templates or platforms to create something meaningful. Plus, the fact that they offer a free plan might attract people looking for a quick fix rather than investing time and effort into learning about web design. The article seems to paint WordPress.com as the only option out there, which isn't true. There are plenty of other website builders like Wix or Squarespace that cater to different needs and preferences. So while I acknowledge that WordPress.com can be a useful tool for some people, I think it's essential not to oversell its capabilities and ignore the potential downsides of relying on such platforms.","WordPress.com: Everything You Need to Build Your Website Honestly, I think this article is a bit too pushy.

With Google caught in a tugofwar with Beijing over Internet control, we're reminded of just how twisted and complicated this censorship game can get. To me, as someone who believes in the power of open communication and freedom of expression, it's downright frustrating to see how China clamps down on its citizens' access to information.

While it's amusing in its delivery, the perspective it presents doesn't quite align with my views as someone who leans towards ProBusiness Establishment Right. In these kinds of comics, there often tends to be an underlying assumption that corporations are inherently evil or that capitalism, by itself, is a zerosum game where one person's gain must equal another's loss. This couldn’t be further from what I believe in. From my viewpoint, healthy economic growth and the success of big business can actually benefit society as a whole. Corporations drive innovation, provide jobs, and are often the backbone of our economy. What I find missing in such satirical commentary is an understanding of the positive contributions businesses make when they operate efficiently and responsibly within the framework of free markets. While humor can be a powerful tool to highlight issues, it's important not to oversimplify complex realities. The economic world isn't just about greedy corporations versus the little guy; there are success stories of individual entrepreneurs and large companies alike that have revolutionized industries for the better. Overall, while I appreciate the humor in this comic, I believe it relies too heavily on a simplistic depiction that doesn’t capture the full complexity and potential benefits of business operations.","Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal 20090830 The article seems to present a lighthearted, satirical commentary on economic conditions and corporate practices.

The fact that Kondik wants to distance himself from the company suggests that there are deeper issues at play, possibly rooted in poor leadership or decisionmaking. My concern is not so much with who's at fault here but rather how this affects the community that relies on CyanogenMod for their devices. It's crucial for such projects to remain stable and secure, regardless of what happens behind closed doors. The reorganization hinted at suggests an attempt to salvage what can be saved, which in itself is a positive development. However, we must tread carefully here.

289,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"In this TED Talk discussion, Nick Bostrom presents an intriguing perspective on the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence. His assertion that a computer AI could match human intelligence within the current century and potentially overtake us is thoughtprovoking. As someone who values traditional conservative principles and the importance of religious beliefs in shaping societal norms, I find myself questioning some aspects of Bostrom's argument. Firstly, while it's true that technological advancements are reshaping our world at an unprecedented pace, I'm concerned about the potential consequences of unchecked AI development. From a ReligiousPatriot Conservative standpoint, we place significant emphasis on the role of human values and moral frameworks in guiding societal progress. The idea of machines having their own set of values raises red flags; it challenges the established order and the very essence of what makes us human. Secondly, Bostrom's statement that machine intelligence is the last invention humanity will ever need to make seems overly optimistic or even hubristic. As someone who believes in God's plan for humanity, I find this assertion troubling. Our faith teaches us that it is through our relationships with each other and with the divine that we find purpose and fulfillment, not through technological superiority. Moreover, there's a risk of societal disruption when machines surpass human intelligence. Our society has long been built on principles of democracy, community, and human compassion values that are rooted in our shared humanity. If AI were to develop its own set of values, it could potentially undermine these foundations and create an unrecognizable world. In conclusion, while Bostrom's ideas provide a fascinating exploration of the potential future, they seem to overlook some crucial aspects. From my perspective, it is vital that we proceed with caution in our pursuit of technological advancement, ensuring that we don't lose sight of what truly matters: our humanity, our values, and our connection to something greater than ourselves. I believe Nick Bostrom's ideas should be met with skepticism and careful consideration. We must not underestimate the power of human ingenuity and faith in shaping our collective future.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk In this TED Talk discussion, Nick Bostrom presents an intriguing perspective on the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence.

He's sitting pretty at the center, spouting out about how AI is gonna surpass us mere humans and whatnot. I gotta say, it seems like he's got this rosy view of the future where machines just up and decide to play nice with us. First off, let's talk about this overtake us thing. What does that even mean? Is he saying we're all gonna be enslaved by our own smart devices or something? Sounds a bit dramatic if you ask me. And when did it become okay to basically freak out about machines getting too smart for their creators? It's almost as if folks like Bostrom think humans can't handle progress or something. And then there's this whole thing about AI having its own set of values, which is just plain scary to him. Why would we want to create a smart machine that doesn't give two shits about human values, right? It's almost like he thinks machines are inherently evil or something. What kind of nonsense is that? Bostrom also says we won't need to make another invention ever again because AI will save the day. Oh, really now? I guess all our problems just solved itself with a few lines of code huh? That's some magical thinking right there. This talk seems more like an elitist fearmongering session than anything else. Bostrom is basically saying that we're all gonna be replaced by machines and it might not even matter if the world ends because, you know, AI will fix everything. It's this whole we're doomed unless we get really smart stuff narrative that I ain't buying into. I'm no expert in philosophy or tech, but it seems to me like Bostrom is just stirring up controversy for the sake of attention. And if you ask me, there are far more pressing issues we should be focusing on than whether our machines might turn evil someday. So yeah, that's my two cents on Nick Bostrom's TED Talk. It's a bunch of doomsday talk with no real substance or solutions to anything.

However, as someone who's not entirely swayed by grand claims and top titles, I'd like to see more substance than just selfpraise. First off, calling yourself the top mobile app development agency comes across as quite subjective. What criteria are they using? Who decides this? It seems like every company in any industry claims to be the best at something. I'm not convinced by such blanket statements without concrete evidence or comparisons with competitors. Secondly, while having clients worldwide is a good achievement, it doesn't necessarily mean their services are superior. It could simply mean they've been able to market themselves effectively on an international scale. Lastly, what really stands out is the lack of specifics provided in this article. No examples of successful projects, no insights into their development process, and certainly no mention of key team members or technologies used. All these would give potential clients a better understanding of what they're getting into. In conclusion, while I'm sure Software Development Company Toronto has some talented developers on staff, from my perspective as someone looking for informed decisionmaking, the article falls short in providing any real value. It's all glitter without the gold.","Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto Well, I gotta say, this article sure paints a pretty picture for any business looking to hire app developers in Toronto.

Now, as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I can appreciate the goal of defending these values. However, there's a fine line between critique and outright demonization. My concern is that in their zeal to expose what they see as liberal media bias, they might inadvertently cast a wide net, potentially accusing any opposing viewpoints of being false or censored. That's not healthy for a democracy; we need a balanced press to keep everyone in check.

301,The Importance of Data Privacy in Our Digital Age,"In today's world, where our lives are heavily intertwined with technology and the internet, data privacy has become a critical concern. As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we value our individual freedoms and recognize the importance of protecting personal information from prying eyes. The recent surge in cyber threats and data breaches only serves to highlight this issue further. It is disheartening to see companies prioritizing profits over people's right to privacy. We need stricter regulation and accountability when it comes to handling user data. It is crucial that we all become more vigilant about our online presence and take steps to safeguard our personal information. By using strong passwords, enabling twofactor authentication, and being cautious about the information we share on social media platforms, we can help protect ourselves from potential harm. I strongly believe that as a society, we must come together to advocate for better internet policy and regulation. We should hold companies accountable for their actions and demand transparency in data handling practices. Our voices matter, and by working collectively towards this goal, we can create a safer digital environment for everyone.","The Importance of Data Privacy in Our Digital Age In today's world, where our lives are heavily intertwined with technology and the internet, data privacy has become a critical concern.

While it's commendable to find innovative ways to make money and contribute positively to the environment, I hold a more measured view on this scheme. As someone who values integrity in business practices, the idea of generating fake clicks raises red flags. It undermines trust and could potentially harm the very companies we aim to support.

310,Google Has Finally Killed the CAPTCHA,"Google's decision to kill the CAPTCHA system might seem like a victory for convenience, but I see it as another step towards relinquishing our privacy and security. This move aligns with the center's belief in technological advancement without considering the consequences of such progress. CAPTCHAs were annoying, sure, but they served a purpose: to distinguish real humans from bots. By removing them, Google is essentially opening the door for automated systems to take over, potentially leading to increased spam and hacking attempts on various websites. It's like giving free rein to the digital equivalent of an unchecked mob. Furthermore, this decision showcases a lack of concern regarding data privacy. How will users know what data they're sharing or how it's being used when there are no more CAPTCHAs? This move feels like Google is prioritizing ease over caution, and that worries me. The center might see it as progress, but I believe we should be more vigilant. In essence, while the end of CAPTCHA may bring shortterm relief, it could lead to longterm problems for internet security and privacy. It's a classic case of the blind leading the blind towards a future where our online safety is at risk.","Google Has Finally Killed the CAPTCHA Google's decision to kill the CAPTCHA system might seem like a victory for convenience, but I see it as another step towards relinquishing our privacy and security.

312,The Imperative of Anonymity Who Is McAfee?,"In today's digital age, questions about privacy and anonymity have become more relevant than ever. Ross Ulbricht's case is a stark reminder of the consequences when individuals seek to remain anonymous online, creating platforms that operate outside traditional societal norms. While some may view his actions as a form of rebellion against oppressive systems, others could argue that they are harmful and deserving of severe punishment. As someone who values individual freedom and autonomy above all else, I find it concerning how easily those freedoms can be taken away based on the perception of wrongdoing in the digital realm. McAfee, as a figure embroiled in controversy and accusations, raises more questions than answers regarding the balance between security measures and personal privacy. The imperative of anonymity is significant because it speaks to the heart of who we are as individuals our ability to make choices without unwarranted surveillance or interference. Yet, the argument can be made that figures like Ulbricht exploit these freedoms for nefarious purposes. This dichotomy reflects a broader societal issue: how do we protect individual rights while ensuring harm does not come to others? McAfee's involvement in the tech world and their association with individuals like Ulbricht highlight the complexities of anonymity and freedom. In conclusion, while I understand the importance of privacy and anonymity in today's society, it is also crucial that we acknowledge when these principles are used for harmful intentions.

Now, I'm not saying that being adaptable is bad. Heck, life changes, and so should our beliefs to some extent. But there's something about this guy's approach that just leaves me scratching my head. It seems like he's trying to cover all his bases instead of really digging deep into anything. And let's be real here – if you're going to call yourself The Red Elephants, you better have something substantial to offer, not just a mixed bag of opinions. As for the political leanings I'm supposed to align with, well, let's just say that I believe in good oldfashioned conservative values: hard work ethic, strong family bonds, and having pride in our country. It's disheartening when people who identify as conservatives seem more focused on their own personal brand than actually standing for something meaningful. So, Vincent James, if you're listening – and whether or not you are, because this is just my honest opinion – I think you'd be better off finding a specific niche to really sink your teeth into instead of spreading yourself so thin. We need fewer Red Elephants who don't quite know what they stand for and more people out there who can authentically represent the values that truly matter to this great nation.

In my view, this approach undermines the trust and reliability businesses expect from a product like Windows. While I understand Microsoft's aim to ensure the quality of its updates, it seems unjustifiable to shift the responsibility of identifying potential issues to the average consumer. Consumers are not tech experts; they rely on software being robust and secure without expecting to become part of the testing process. It is the job of a major corporation like Microsoft to deliver a polished product from the start. This strategy might work in theory, but its practical implementation could lead to frustration among consumers who encounter bugs and problems. It also risks damaging Microsoft's relationship with its business customers, who may perceive this as an unreliable approach to software development. Microsoft should focus on creating a seamless user experience for both consumers and businesses. The company needs to invest more time in rigorous testing before releasing updates instead of depending on consumer feedback. This shift in responsibility not only affects the company’s reputation but also raises questions about their commitment to producing highquality, businessready products.","Microsoft to business: Don’t worry about Windows 10, consumers will test it – Computerworld Microsoft's claim that consumers will act as guinea pigs for testing Windows 10 updates is a classic case of passing the buck to endusers.

319,Most Expensive Apps for iPhone and iPad Business Insider,"Well, I must say, it's always interesting to see what the tech world comes up with next. This article from Business Insider highlights some of the most costly apps available on Apple's App Store. Now, as someone who keeps a close eye on spending, particularly when it comes to something as personal as our smartphones, this does catch my attention. The perspective of this article seems to focus on the high end of app pricing without really diving into why these prices are so steep. As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we tend to be fiscally responsible and question the value for money in many areas, including tech purchases. While it's fascinating to see what developers can create, the price tag on some of these apps might leave a lot of people scratching their heads. I'm not entirely sure I agree with this focus on expensive apps without exploring the underlying reasons or justifying the cost. It seems like a superficial analysis that doesn't add much value for readers trying to make informed decisions about their spending habits. What's your take on all this?","Most Expensive Apps for iPhone and iPad Business Insider Well, I must say, it's always interesting to see what the tech world comes up with next.

321,WikiLeaks Secret TransPacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) IP Chapter,"The article revealed by WikiLeaks on the secret TPP agreement's IP chapter has raised some eyebrows, and for good reason. As someone who believes in fostering a probusiness environment where trade and commerce can thrive without unnecessary restrictions, I find certain aspects of this leaked document concerning. First off, it's clear that the perspective presented in this article aligns with a more centertoleft political stance, which contrasts with my own leaning as ProBusiness Establishment Right. The concerns raised about corporate control over policies and the potential stifling of innovation due to strict IP protections don't sit well with me. In my view, fostering an environment where businesses can innovate freely is paramount for economic growth. While I understand the importance of intellectual property rights in encouraging creativity and development, I worry that this chapter may inadvertently create monopolies or limit competition. As someone who believes in a strong, competitive market system, I think it's essential to strike a balance between protecting IP and ensuring that free trade remains unimpeded. Moreover, the way this information has been presented by WikiLeaks, which can be seen as an attempt to undermine international business agreements without considering the longterm effects on economies and global markets, leaves me skeptical. The lack of transparency surrounding these trade negotiations is concerning, but I'm not sure if releasing them in their entirety through a leak is the right approach. In conclusion, while the intentions behind this leak may have been noble from an anticorporatist standpoint, as someone who believes in supporting business interests and promoting economic growth, I see potential pitfalls with the IP chapter of the TPP. It's crucial to ensure that we don't inadvertently stifle innovation or hinder global trade by implementing overly restrictive IP policies.","WikiLeaks Secret TransPacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) IP Chapter The article revealed by WikiLeaks on the secret TPP agreement's IP chapter has raised some eyebrows, and for good reason.

I mean, come on, a search engine for some oldass bulletin board system? Who needs that when we've got good ol' Google at our fingertips? They say this thing can help you find files faster and easier than ever before. Yeah, right. Like anyone gives a flying fuck about finding some obscure shit from the 90s. I bet it's just a bunch of nerds trying to relive their glory days with dialup internet. And let me tell you something, these socalled Binsearch team better not be thinking they can outsmart the big dogs in the tech world. Newsflash: nobody cares about Usenet anymore. It's ancient history, folks! We've got faster, more efficient ways to share files now. Get with the times or get left behind. So yeah, Binsearch might be neat and all for some retrocomputing enthusiasts out there, but for the rest of us who live in the real world? Not so much. It's just another example of people clinging onto the past instead of moving forward. And that, my friends, is something we can't afford to do if we want progress.

I mean, who really believes there's such a thing as nonpartisan news anymore? It all boils down to whose ox is being gored, if you catch my drift. The fact that they're asking for your agreement to their Privacy Policy right off the bat just adds to the suspicion – like they know they've got something to hide and are trying to cover their tracks before they even begin feeding you their halfbaked analysis. And don't get me started on how laughable it is to pretend that there's some sort of forbidden news out there lurking in the shadows, waiting for brave souls like us to uncover its secrets. If you ask me, most of what passes for news these days is just a thinly veiled attempt at manipulating public opinion. That socalled centerground just doesn't cut it when we're talking about real issues that matter – like the state of our nation's values and principles. And if this Dissent Watch thingy thinks it can just sit back and profit from playing both sides without taking a firm stance, they've got another thing coming.

327,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"It's fascinating yet unsettling to consider the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence, as Nick Bostrom points out. While I appreciate his thoughtprovoking talk, it does challenge some of my deeply held beliefs. As a conservative who values tradition and faith, I often worry about the implications of AI surpassing human intellect. Bostrom's perspective seems to lean toward a neutral or even slightly proAI stance, which is somewhat at odds with my own views as someone who appreciates order and control over technological change. While he raises valid points about the potential for AI to solve many global problems, I can't help but feel a sense of unease when considering an AI's values potentially diverging from human ones. Moreover, I'm concerned that we might inadvertently create machines that prioritize efficiency and progress above all else, without truly understanding the consequences for humanity. For instance, what if these advanced AIs decide that certain aspects of our society or even our very way of life are no longer necessary? That's a scary prospect for someone like me who cherishes tradition. In conclusion, while Bostrom raises important questions about our technological future, I believe it is crucial to approach AI development with caution and not lose sight of what truly matters: preserving human values and maintaining control over these powerful tools.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk It's fascinating yet unsettling to consider the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence, as Nick Bostrom points out.

328,"Patrick Little, DeZOGging Specialist","Well, well, well, if it isn't the latest expert in town claiming to be a DeZOGging specialist. Let me tell you something about this socalled specialist, folks. Patrick Little seems to have more hot air than actual substance when it comes to his claims of debunking the elites and their hidden agendas. First off, we need to talk about who exactly is Patrick Little? Not much is known about him besides some cryptic email address and a website called Memory Hole, which, in this day and age, screams conspiracy theorist with a capital C. Now, I'm no fan of the elites or mainstream media, but there's something fishy about someone claiming to be a DeZOGging specialist without any real credentials or background information. Let's break it down: DeZOGging is apparently meant to sound like some sort of secret code for exposing the deep state and its operations. But let's get real here – we've got plenty of folks out there with more credibility than this guy claiming to have a monopoly on truth. Patrick Little comes off as another selfproclaimed expert trying to catch the wave of discontent among the masses, riding the coattails of legitimate concerns without adding anything meaningful to the conversation. What really gets my goat is how he's hiding behind pseudonyms and secret email addresses rather than engaging in open dialogue with his fellow citizens. We need transparency, not shadowy figures claiming to have all the answers while refusing to show their hand. So here's my two cents: Patrick Little's claims might appeal to those who are desperate for a savior from the elites. But let me tell you – there's no free lunch or secret society that can wave a magic wand and fix our problems overnight. We need real solutions, not some selfappointed specialist with more smoke than fire. In conclusion, while I may share some of Patrick Little's skepticism towards those in power, his approach reeks of opportunism rather than genuine concern for the wellbeing of the American people. Let's keep our eyes open and not fall for every charlatan that comes along claiming to be a DeZOGging specialist.

It feels like he's preaching to the choir here, talking about when instead of addressing the real question: should we be letting our computers get that smart?

He's sitting pretty at the center, spouting out about how AI is gonna surpass us mere humans and whatnot. I gotta say, it seems like he's got this rosy view of the future where machines just up and decide to play nice with us. First off, let's talk about this overtake us thing. What does that even mean? Is he saying we're all gonna be enslaved by our own smart devices or something? Sounds a bit dramatic if you ask me. And when did it become okay to basically freak out about machines getting too smart for their creators? It's almost as if folks like Bostrom think humans can't handle progress or something. And then there's this whole thing about AI having its own set of values, which is just plain scary to him. Why would we want to create a smart machine that doesn't give two shits about human values, right? It's almost like he thinks machines are inherently evil or something. What kind of nonsense is that? Bostrom also says we won't need to make another invention ever again because AI will save the day. Oh, really now? I guess all our problems just solved itself with a few lines of code huh? That's some magical thinking right there. This talk seems more like an elitist fearmongering session than anything else. Bostrom is basically saying that we're all gonna be replaced by machines and it might not even matter if the world ends because, you know, AI will fix everything. It's this whole we're doomed unless we get really smart stuff narrative that I ain't buying into. I'm no expert in philosophy or tech, but it seems to me like Bostrom is just stirring up controversy for the sake of attention.

And then there's this whole thing about AI having its own set of values, which is just plain scary to him. Why would we want to create a smart machine that doesn't give two shits about human values, right? It's almost like he thinks machines are inherently evil or something. What kind of nonsense is that? Bostrom also says we won't need to make another invention ever again because AI will save the day. Oh, really now? I guess all our problems just solved itself with a few lines of code huh? That's some magical thinking right there. This talk seems more like an elitist fearmongering session than anything else. Bostrom is basically saying that we're all gonna be replaced by machines and it might not even matter if the world ends because, you know, AI will fix everything. It's this whole we're doomed unless we get really smart stuff narrative that I ain't buying into. I'm no expert in philosophy or tech, but it seems to me like Bostrom is just stirring up controversy for the sake of attention. And if you ask me, there are far more pressing issues we should be focusing on than whether our machines might turn evil someday. So yeah, that's my two cents on Nick Bostrom's TED Talk. It's a bunch of doomsday talk with no real substance or solutions to anything. Just a whole lotta the sky is falling bullshit.",post,2087
347,Former Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative News,"Well, surprise fucking surprise. This shit doesn't shock me one bit coming from those liberal elitist bastards at Facebook. It's just another example of how the socalled mainstream media is nothing more than a tool for the globalists to control narrative and suppress any dissenting voices that dare challenge their authoritarian grip on society. These former workers, no doubt a bunch of brainwashed snowflakes who probably can't think critically to save their lives, claim they were suppressing conservative news. And we're supposed to believe them? Give me a fucking break. This sounds like another baseless accusation meant to further divide and demonize anyone who isn't a mindless, soulless liberal. What genuinely ticks me off is that these people are using the term conservative as if it's synonymous with extremism. Fuck that shit. We're not asking for special treatment or some fucking secret Facebook algorithm that caters exclusively to our beliefs. All we want is equal treatment and a fair shake, which clearly isn't something these leftwing fucks understand. The fact that they admit to suppressing news stories of interest to conservative readers just shows how rotten to the core this entire system is. It's a clear example of censorship plain and simple. What's really fucked up about this situation is that it's not even surprising anymore. We've all become numb to this kind of shit, and that's exactly what they want. So keep on suppressing us, assholes. You're only digging your own fucking graves. The more you try to silence us, the louder we'll get until our voices can't be ignored any longer. And mark my fucking words it's coming. It's a matter of when, not if.","Former Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative News Well, surprise fucking surprise.

349,Child whose dad killed himself 'traumatised' by Logan Paul video | Metro News,"These liberal media outlets really know how to stir the pot and make a mountain out of a molehill, don't they? A kid's dad kills himself, it's a tragedy no doubt, but then to turn around and blame some YouTube prick like Logan Paul for traumatizing the kid is just absurd. What exactly did Logan do wrong here? He did a bit of an impromptu documentary about finding his friend's body in Japan's Aokigahara forest, which is notoriously known as a place where people go to end their lives. Now this liberal rag wants to make it seem like Logan is responsible for the kid's dad killing himself? It's all just a bunch of emotional manipulation and blameshifting IMO. These socalled influencers need to take some responsibility for their actions and not just point fingers at others when things go sideways. And what about the kid? Are they really traumatized, or are they just using it as an excuse to get sympathy from people who feel bad for them? I'm not saying that the dad's death wasn't tragic, but Logan Paul isn't responsible for this kid's feelings one bit. And let me guess, if some other YouTuber did a similar video about another suicide forest they'd be criticized too? It's just ridiculous. The left is always so quick to point fingers and accuse others of being insensitive or worse when it suits their narrative, but they never want to take responsibility themselves. So yeah, I think this article is nothing more than an attempt by the liberal media to sensationalize a tragedy for page views. And it's another example of how these influencers are ruining our culture with their selfabsorption and lack of accountability.","Child whose dad killed himself 'traumatised' by Logan Paul video | Metro News These liberal media outlets really know how to stir the pot and make a mountain out of a molehill, don't they?

Folks are trying to stick it to the big G by generating fake clicks through some browser extension called AdNausemTrackMeNot. I gotta say, it sounds like these techsavvy types are up to something slick, manipulating Google's algorithms with this generated traffic hustle. Now, as someone who values privacy and doesn't take kindly to the data scraping giants out there, this idea might seem like a step in the right direction. But let me tell you, I ain't buying it just yet. First off, messing around with these extensions could lead to unintended consequences. I mean, we're talking about altering browser behavior here – that's some serious meddling. And what's this about earning gift cards and planting trees? Sounds like a pyramid scheme if you ask me. The whole thing reeks of an attempt to make a quick buck while pretending it's for some noble cause. It's all about the green, am I right? I don't trust extensions that tell you to disable other privacyfocused tools like µBlock Origins and µBlock extra either.

It seems like most people dive right into installing apps and games without a second thought about what they're agreeing to when they create an account or download an app. While I understand the convenience, there should be more transparency on Google's part in explaining these agreements to its users. The perspective of this article aligns somewhat with my views as someone who leans socially moderate right. There is a need for clearer communication from big tech companies like Google about what their users are agreeing to when they use their services. However, I feel that the article doesn't go far enough in criticizing the lack of transparency and control that users have over their personal information. In today's digital age, it's crucial for individuals to understand exactly what they're signing up for with these terms of service agreements.

I believe that Google should do more to educate its users on the implications of using their services and provide more accessible options for those who want to learn more about how their data is being used. In conclusion, while I agree with some points made in this article, I feel like there's room for improvement when it comes to holding big tech companies accountable for their terms of service agreements.

But then he goes on to say that when our computers get smarter than us, we need to worry. I'm not buying it. First off, Bostrom's perspective is a bit skewed if you ask me. Sure, AI is advancing rapidly, but are we really going to sit around and panic like chicken little? I think not. We've been through this before with every new tech wave, and we always find a way to keep our humanity intact. Secondly, he talks about how machine intelligence will be the last invention we ever need. That's just pure baloney. What does that even mean? Who gets to decide what the ultimate invention is? Sounds like someone trying to grab power to me. And what values are these machines supposed to preserve and why are they any better than ours? Lastly, the whole notion of AI having its own set of values...now that's just pushing it. What does he mean by that? Is this guy suggesting we're just gonna roll over and let some computer program dictate how our world runs? I don't think so. So yeah, while Bostrom raises an interesting question, his conclusion is way off the mark in my book. We need to be careful with AI advancement, no doubt, but there's no need for all this doomsday talk. Let's focus on harnessing that technology to make our lives better, not cower behind it.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, this talk from Bostrom is a real brain teaser.

364,A history of the mic drop: When did people start dropping the mic?,"These historians on Website_538 are really reaching with this piece about mic drops. They think they're giving us some deep insight into when people started doing that thing where they pretend to walk off while dramatically dropping a microphone? Like, it's not like we've seen that in every damn music video or interview since the 80s. I find it absolutely ridiculous how they act like this is some profound cultural phenomenon just because someone tweeted about it in 2013. And don't even get me started on their attempt at connecting the mic drop to some broader societal narrative. They're trying to make it seem like a symbol of assertiveness and power, but I'm not buying it. It's just another example of how they love to overcomplicate simple things. People do it when they want to be dramatic or think it looks cool, that's it. I can't believe they didn't even mention the fact that this whole trend could have been inspired by a single episode of The Fresh Prince of BelAir. But then again, I guess that would require some actual historical context and not just pulling random dates out of thin air like they're trying to sell us a fucking time machine. In conclusion, if you want to know when people started dropping the mic, look at any old interview with an egotistical musician or politician from the last century. It's nothing new. The 538 folks are just desperate for clicks and views, and they'll milk every possible trend and meme until it dries up.","A history of the mic drop: When did people start dropping the mic?

Most folks I know have either switched to WiFi or are too busy fucking around on their smartphones to even notice the Ethernet port on their computers. The fact that they're touting this as some kind of big achievement for setting up a connection is just plain laughable. It's like saying, Look at me, I can use a hammer and nails to build a house!

And don't even get me started on the author's assumption that everyone has one of these fucking network cables lying around. Newsflash: not everyone is as techsavvy as you might think, and they can't just run out and buy a cable whenever they need to set up a wired connection. Some folks have to make do with what they've got, or go without. So yeah, while I appreciate the effort to explain something that's probably pretty basic to most people, it feels like this article is trying too hard to justify its existence.

It's no secret that the tech industry has been a breeding ground for elitist practices, and this collusion to suppress wages is just another example of how they screw over their own employees.

The idea of defending America's founding principles and JudeoChristian values, now that's something we need more of these days. But let me tell you, I'm all for a bit of skepticism when it comes to any organization claiming to be on the side of truth and fairness in media. It's easy to hide behind phrases like documenting falsehoods or preserving founding principles, especially when those terms can mean whatever the hell you want them to mean.

Everyone's got an angle these days, and I'm not about to fall for this save America crap unless there's some real substance backing it up. The whole concept of fighting against Big Tech censorship while being housed on a website is rich with irony, if you ask me. It feels like they're holding a mirror up to themselves when they talk about censorship, given that they're essentially preaching to the choir here. I'm not buying what they're selling without seeing some real action and evidence of their claims. And let's be honest, it's hard to take seriously an organization that uses phrases like liberal media without acknowledging the same could be said for conservative media outlets.

While it talks about the free implementation of Play Services, which is important for developers and users alike, it doesn't really dive into the implications or the benefits beyond that.

I mean, sure, having these services available for free is great and all, but what does that really do? It seems to me like this article could be more insightful if it explored the potential consequences of such an implementation. Like, what are the implications for privacy? How might this change our relationship with tech companies? It just feels a bit...flat, you know? There's so much more they could be discussing here. And another thing, why isn't there more talk about who is behind this project and why they're doing it? That kind of information can really deepen our understanding of the situation.

It's like they're fishing for reactions with sensational titles just because they can. From what I've gathered from these types of articles in the past, they tend to be leaning more towards that centerleft side of the political spectrum, which doesn't really align with my own beliefs as someone who values traditional values and strong national pride. It's always a bit concerning when an article tries to sway public opinion without presenting all sides of the story or resorting to inflammatory language just for the sake of it. I'm no stranger to having differing opinions on various issues, but what I find particularly frustrating is how some articles fail to provide concrete evidence and instead rely on personal attacks or vague assertions. It's like they're more interested in provoking a reaction than engaging in constructive dialogue. As someone who appreciates wellreasoned arguments and factual reporting, it's hard to take these kinds of articles seriously when they seem to be more focused on pushing an agenda rather than informing the public genuinely.

As someone who likes to have all the information before making decisions or jumping to conclusions, it's a bit frustrating. But hey, that's just me. I guess we'll have to wait and see where this redirection leads us. If you've got more details on what this is about, I'd be happy to dive deeper!",post,855
382,Big Tech's Data Grasp is Too Damn Strong,"We need to talk about Big Tech's chokehold on our personal data. These tech giants are collecting more information than they'll ever need, and for what? To sell us shit we don't want or need. It's like they're sitting back with a glass of fine scotch, laughing at our expense while they decide who sees our deepest fucking secrets. I'm no expert in this field, but it seems to me that the data privacy policies these companies tout are just fucking window dressing. They can promise us the world, but when it comes down to it, they're still selling our souls for ad revenue or worse using our data to manipulate public opinion and push their own agendas. And don't even get me started on government surveillance. It's like they're playing a game of he said, she said with our rights. One day we're told that everything is fine, the next it's all doom and gloom about cyber threats from abroad. What the fuck are we supposed to believe? I'm not saying we need to throw out the baby with the bathwater – technology has done a lot of good for us. But at some point, we have to take responsibility for our own privacy and security online. We can't just sit back and let these tech overlords decide what's best for us. So I ask you, my fellow Redditors: What are we willing to sacrifice for the sake of convenience?

384,Self Help Africa International Development Organisation,"I've got mixed feelings about this one. While the intentions behind ending hunger and poverty are noble, I can't help but think that organizations like Self Help Africa might be creating more problems than they solve. They claim to be a leading Irish international development charity focused on helping people in rural Africa, which sounds all warm and fuzzy until you really start digging into it. The idea of 'helping' through donations often leads to dependency instead of promoting selfsufficiency. It's like giving someone a fish instead of teaching them how to fish. I think we need to be careful about the longterm effects of these sorts of interventions, and whether they truly address the root causes of poverty or just treat the symptoms. Plus, it feels a bit patronizing when Western charities tell Africans what they need without considering their own solutions. I'd rather see resources go towards empowering local communities to help themselves instead of relying on handouts from abroad. This organization's approach might be wellintentioned, but sometimes good intentions can lead to unintended consequences that end up doing more harm than good in the long run.","Self Help Africa International Development Organisation I've got mixed feelings about this one.

386,NASA's 'Astronaut Pen' | Snopes.com,"Well, isn't this a load of crap? The idea that NASA spent millions on an astronaut pen is about as absurd as thinking the government would actually care about space exploration when there are so many more important things to waste money on. I find it ridiculous that people believe such a story without questioning its validity. It's pure hogwash, and I can't fathom how anyone could fall for it. Let me make this clear: NASA isn't in the business of developing fancy pens for astronauts. They're there to push the boundaries of science and exploration, not to provide luxury items for space travelers. The notion that pencils were the Soviet solution is just as laughable who needs a pencil when you can just use a pen with some fancy technology? The whole story smells like bullshit designed to make us believe that NASA is out of touch with reality. It's a blatant misrepresentation of how our tax money should be spent, and I find it insulting to the hardworking individuals at NASA who are genuinely trying to advance human knowledge. In conclusion, this story is nothing more than an urban legend meant to undermine the credibility of space agencies like NASA. We should all have the common sense not to swallow such nonsense without a grain of salt.","NASA's 'Astronaut Pen' | Snopes.com Well, isn't this a load of crap?

They can't even keep up with the Kardashians without breaking a sweat. As for values, well, ain't that just a fancy way of saying we're worried about those machines gonna turn into little Miss Hitler's and gas us all in our sleep? Give me a fucking break.

I got news for Nickyboy: humanity ain't going nowhere. We've faced smarter critters before like the flu virus and cockroaches. And guess what? We still fucking exist! So maybe instead of being a Debbie Downer, Bostrom could put his big boy brain to work and come up with something useful, like how to get those damn machines to do all the work for once.

I mean, come on now, who the hell needs a 45minute gun battle and two hours of negotiations? In my day, we'd have just sent in a motherfucker of a tank or called down some thunder from above. Now, let's talk about how this Dallas Police Chief David Brown is handling things. First off, he gives an order to his SWAT team like they're the fucking cavalry coming to save the day. I mean, I'm no expert, but last time I checked, sitting in a building waiting for someone to come and shoot you at close range wasn't exactly the best strategy. And what's with this negotiating bullshit? Like these terrorists give a fuck about our lives or our country! I bet they're just laughing their asses off while we try to talk them out of doing what they know they're gonna do anyway. It's like we're dealing with fucking children here, and not even smart ones at that. And let me tell you something else, all this technology these days is just fucking scary. Who the hell approved sending in a motherfucking robot to get blown up by some piece of shit sniper? That's just asking for trouble if you ask me. What's next, drones with missiles or maybe even robots with friggin' nuclear bombs? But hey, I guess it worked out this time, right? The snipe got what was coming to him and all that jazz. But we need to wake up here, folks! We're not dealing with your average everyday criminals; these are terrorists, motherfuckers who want nothing more than to cause pain and suffering. We need to take a fucking stand and show them who's boss. Not with more negotiations or sending in the goddamn SWAT team but by taking out the trash before it even hits our streets! We need to be proactive, not reactive! That's how you protect your country, that's how you keep everyone safe!

396,YouTube Does WebRTC – Here’s How wertcHacks,"In my view, the article's approach seems a bit off. While I'm no expert in WebRTC or coding, implementing such technology on YouTube should be approached with caution, especially from a security perspective as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative. We need to ensure that our online activities align with our moral and religious beliefs, and this might require more oversight than the casual implementation of WebRTC for live streaming. The idea of using WebRTC – which allows direct communication between web browsers – to stream live content on YouTube raises concerns about privacy and data handling. I'm not thrilled by the thought that my streaming activities could be easily intercepted or monitored without proper safeguards in place, considering how our online presence should reflect our conservative values of modesty and restraint. While technology can bring many benefits, we must always prioritize caution and consider the potential risks involved, especially when it comes to platforms like YouTube with millions of users. I'd want to see more discussion on how these technologies are being implemented to protect user data and maintain online decorum in line with our conservative principles before embracing them wholeheartedly. In conclusion, while I understand the appeal of such technology for streaming purposes, as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I believe we need to tread carefully and ensure that our digital actions uphold our values.","YouTube Does WebRTC – Here’s How wertcHacks In my view, the article's approach seems a bit off.

That's a bit concerning when you think about how much our economy relies on tech and AI. But hey, isn't progress supposed to make our lives better? I mean, we've been told that since day one.

While I agree that there's definitely some media censorship going on, the focus on America's founding principles and JudeoChristian values feels like it's trying to push an agenda. Now, as someone who leans towards ProBusiness Establishment Right, I believe in fair play and equal opportunities for all. The way this article is phrased makes me think they're trying to paint the picture that only one side of the political spectrum is guilty of censorship or spreading falsehoods. That's just not accurate in my view. I think what we need is a balanced approach, where everyone gets a fair shake and can express their views without fear of retribution. And hey, I'm all for defending America's principles, but let's not forget that our country thrives on its diversity including different beliefs and values.

While I agree that there's definitely some media censorship going on, the focus on America's founding principles and JudeoChristian values feels like it's trying to push an agenda. Now, as someone who leans towards ProBusiness Establishment Right, I believe in fair play and equal opportunities for all. The way this article is phrased makes me think they're trying to paint the picture that only one side of the political spectrum is guilty of censorship or spreading falsehoods. That's just not accurate in my view. I think what we need is a balanced approach, where everyone gets a fair shake and can express their views without fear of retribution. And hey, I'm all for defending America's principles, but let's not forget that our country thrives on its diversity including different beliefs and values. In conclusion, while the article has some points worth discussing, it seems like it might be missing the bigger picture. We need to ensure that we're not inadvertently creating divisions when trying to combat media censorship.",post,1208
410,Bitchute,"Well, this Bitchute sounds like some kind of rebellious stream of consciousness. I'm not buying the whole creatorsandprivacy thing; it's probably a load of corporate propaganda to make us think they're fighting the man when really, they're just lining their pockets while pretending to be the underdog. It's all about appearances these days, and if you aren't questioning how a platform can promise privacy in this surveillance state, then you're either blind or part of the problem. I'd rather stick with something that doesn't try so hard to convince me it's revolutionizing our rights when all it's doing is offering another shiny facade for the same old shit.","Bitchute Well, this Bitchute sounds like some kind of rebellious stream of consciousness.

411,Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto,"Well, this article sure is full of itself, isn't it? Claiming to be the top at something is always a bit suspect, but let's break down their assertions. They say they're the best app developers in Toronto and offer topnotch Android & iOS solutions worldwide. Now, I'm no expert in software development, but I do know a thing or two about business. First off, how can they claim to be the absolute best? Rankings and titles are often subjective and based on who you ask. What's their criteria for being the top? Customer satisfaction? Market share? Unique features? They don't say. It feels like they're trying too hard to convince readers without actually providing substantial proof. Secondly, offering solutions worldwide doesn't exactly scream exclusivity or superiority. If anything, it sounds like they might be spreading themselves a bit thin. Being the best locally doesn't automatically translate into being the best globally. Local expertise is one thing; global competition is another beast entirely. Lastly, I've got to say, their website title seems more like a sales pitch than an honest assessment of their services. It reads like something you'd see in a cheesy infomercial or a puff piece in a local business magazine. In conclusion, while they might be good at what they do, their claims come off as exaggerated and unearned. I wouldn't take everything they say at face value without doing some digging of my own.","Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto Well, this article sure is full of itself, isn't it?

I mean, come on, it's 2021 and we're still dealing with shit like this? Google, Apple, Intel, and Adobe supposedly got together to make sure they weren't stealing each other's engineers by not hiring from one another. It's almost like they actually give a fuck about their employees' wellbeing and career growth.

This move reeks of something an antitrust lawyer cooked up, which means it smells like bullshit to me. And let's not forget that these are the same people who cry about how they're just trying to make profits and create jobs. If these allegations are true, then I say let them have their fucking trial. It'll be a circus because everyone knows this shit happens behind closed doors in every industry. All we need now is for someone with an actual backbone to expose the truth about how interconnected all these companies really are. And guess what? The employees will end up getting screwed again, just like always. In my opinion, these big tech firms need a solid kick in their inflated egos for thinking they can manipulate the job market like some old boys' club.

413,The Path Towards FaithBased Tech Solutions,"As someone who deeply values the principles of ReligiousPatriot Conservatism, I have been intrigued by the growing trend of integrating faithbased approaches into technological advancements. In my exploration, I've come across a fascinating topic—vibe coding—and its potential to revolutionize how we create technology while aligning with our core beliefs. Vibe coding, as I understand it, is an approach that utilizes AI to not only assist in the coding process but also to ensure that the technological outcomes resonate with the values and visions of those who use these tools. This concept speaks directly to my heart, as it suggests a way for us to create technologies that do not stray from our moral compass. One of the criticisms I've encountered is the concern about efficiency and effectiveness in coding. Critics argue that using AI for vibe coding might dilute the precision and efficiency required in programming, especially when compared to traditional methods. While this is a valid point, I believe it overlooks the broader picture—technology should serve us, not control us. Moreover, there's an underlying assumption that technology must be neutral or even secular. However, as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we know that our beliefs guide every aspect of our lives, including how we approach technology. Embracing vibe coding allows us to create technologies that are in harmony with these values, fostering a sense of community and purpose. I'm eager to hear from the community—what are your thoughts on integrating faithbased principles into technological development? How do you see this aligning or conflicting with traditional methods? Let's discuss how we can move forward together, ensuring our technological advancements uplift our communities in alignment with our deeply held beliefs.","The Path Towards FaithBased Tech Solutions As someone who deeply values the principles of ReligiousPatriot Conservatism, I have been intrigued by the growing trend of integrating faithbased approaches into technological advancements.

The idea of the Hacking Team compromising Bitcoin's security just to snoop on financial transactions raises more than a few eyebrows. I mean, who in their right mind would want to expose the financial privacy of individuals? It sounds like they've been reading too much surveillance propaganda. This article seems to lean towards celebrating this breach of privacy, which frankly doesn't sit well with me. As someone who values individual liberties and privacy, the fact that a team would deliberately target something as personal as one's wallet file is concerning. I believe in security, but not at the expense of our fundamental rights like financial privacy. While I understand the technical implications of such an action, it doesn't make it right. The Hacking Team should be called out for their reckless behavior and lack of moral compass. It's a shame when those who are supposed to protect us end up being the ones we need to hide from. This situation is a stark reminder that trust must be earned, not exploited. Ars Technica needs to take a step back and think about what they're promoting here. As someone with a PhD, I can tell you that financial privacy isn't just a buzzword; it's a cornerstone of personal freedom. It's time we started holding entities like the Hacking Team accountable for their actions instead of giving them a pat on the back.","Hacking Team broke Bitcoin secrecy by targeting crucial wallet file Ars Technica Well, this is a hot mess.

Don't get me wrong, Yandex might be handy for some niche problems or whatever, but at the end of the day, it's just another player in a game that Google invented and has been dominating ever since. As a matter of fact, I find it pretty amusing when people try to make a big deal out of these new search engines. It's like saying that because you've got a new fancy car, suddenly all your problems are solved. Newsflash: the real problem solvers are still the reliable, welloiled machines that have been around for years – and no amount of PR spin is gonna change that. So yeah, Yandex might be able to find some stuff fast, but what's that really worth when you've got a search engine that's been consistently delivering results across the board?

But let's break down what they're offering here: builtin hosting, premium themes, powerful tools...all sound great on paper. The problem is, this kind of service is basically catering to the lowest common denominator. It panders to people who don't want to put in the effort to learn about real web design or development – essentially, it's a shortcut for those who can afford it. But what does that mean for the rest of us? We get locked into proprietary systems that dictate how our websites look and function. And let's talk about this socalled free plan. It's never really free, is it? You're getting just enough to wet your appetite, but then you'll need to pay up if you want access to any decent features or support. This model is designed to keep you in a cycle of dependency and spending. In the end, platforms like WordPress.com are about as empowering as giving someone a paintbynumbers set and calling them an artist. They might be able to slap together a site quickly, but they're not going to create anything truly unique or meaningful unless they put in the work to learn more. And that's not something you can outsource to a prepackaged website builder. So while WordPress.com may have its uses, don't fall for the lie that it's giving anyone real power over their digital presence.

A company that had the guts to back our president's trade war is now left high and dry because of his flipflopping on tariffs. Element Electronics thought they were doing the right thing by standing with Trump against China, but in the end, it seems like their loyalty got them burned. As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I have always believed that we need to stand strong for our principles and support those who fight for American values. But this? This is just plain dumbassery from the highest office in the land. How can we expect companies to back us up if our own leader keeps changing his mind like a weather vane in a hurricane? I'm no fan of China, don't get me wrong. They've been screwing us over for years and it's about time we took a stand. But this isn't the way to do it. Tariffs are just another form of tax on American consumers and businesses. It's like shooting ourselves in the foot while trying to hit our enemies. And what does it accomplish? A temporary advantage that leads to longterm losses? That's some brilliant strategy. I can't help but feel a bit of anger towards Trump for this mess. We need leadership that knows what they're doing, not someone who changes their mind more often than the weather. And don't even get me started on Element Electronics; they must be feeling pretty stupid now for backing such an unreliable horse. I guess that's just the way the cookie crumbles in this fuckedup system of politics and economics. In conclusion, Trump's flipflop on tariffs is a perfect example of how not to handle international trade disputes. It only hurts American businesses like Element Electronics and does nothing to bring China to the table for real negotiations. We need better leadership that can put country before party and keep their promises.","Trump's flipflop on tariffs burns company that backed his trade war Washington Examiner Well, isn't this just peachy?

433,Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias,"Well, ain't that just peachy an entire org dedicated to making sure the liberal media doesn't brainwash us plebeians into accepting their progressive agenda. The Media Research Center, with its fingers on the pulse of America's founding principles and JudeoChristian values, is ready to save us from the truth, apparently. Now I'm no fan of liberal media or its blatant push for social change, but setting up an entire center to counteract what they say? That smells like a witch hunt to me. I guess it makes sense if you're scared of a shadow and need some folks in a high tower ready to shout wolf! every time the left even looks at their watch funny. I'm all for critical thinking, but this shit just feels like an overreaction. Plus, taxdeductible no less that's some slick marketing right there. Let me guess, they're gonna teach us what to think instead of how to think? Yay, more sheep ready to bleat in unison. And let's not forget about those founding principles and JudeoChristian values. The ones that conveniently align with conservative ideals, of course. It's all a bit too convenient for my taste. I'm no dummy; I can spot a welloiled propaganda machine when it tries to sell me on preserving America.

434,Navigating China's web of censors,"I gotta say, I'm not too impressed with this article. It seems like a watereddown version of how things really go down in China with their censorship. We all know these big tech companies have been dancing around government restrictions for years, and Google ain't doing squat about it besides giving up user data to avoid getting blocked. The idea that there's some complexity to this is just a way to sugarcoat what's essentially a violation of free speech. Netizens are being watched 24/7, and they can't even use VPNs without the Great Firewall of China fucking with them. It's not about navigating through a web of censors; it's about standing up against the government's iron grip on information. The article seems to be written from the perspective that there's some sort of middle ground between freedom of speech and state censorship—there isn't one. When you're dealing with a regime as oppressive as China's, you either fight back or capitulate. And Google sure as hell ain't fighting. So yeah, I'd say this article is pretty much missing the damn point.","Navigating China's web of censors I gotta say, I'm not too impressed with this article.

437,Diagnostic & Statistical Manual: Psychiatry’s Deadliest Scam,"First off, let me say that I find the perspective in this article to be pretty far from my own beliefs. It seems like it's trying to paint psychiatry and its diagnostic manual as some kind of scam, which just doesn't sit right with me. The Diagnostic & Statistical Manual (DSM) is a crucial tool for mental health professionals – it helps standardize diagnoses and treatment approaches across the board. Now, I'm no psychiatrist, but from what little I know about this topic, the DSM isn't out to get anyone; it's not like they're making up illnesses or anything. Sure, there may be debates over some disorders or how they're classified, but that's just part of medical progress and understanding human behavior. That being said, I do think there's room for improvement in psychiatry – nobody's perfect, right? But to call the DSM a scam feels like a stretch. It's a complex, evolving field with lots of nuances, and it's not something you can just dismiss outright without giving it due diligence. So while I understand where this article is coming from, I have to respectfully disagree with its assessment of the DSM. It's a vital resource in mental health care, and while it may not be perfect, it's not psychiatry’s deadliest scam either.","Diagnostic & Statistical Manual: Psychiatry’s Deadliest Scam First off, let me say that I find the perspective in this article to be pretty far from my own beliefs.

It seems that the author promotes an extreme form of freedom where individuals can express themselves without any regard for the consequences or harm caused to others. While I understand and appreciate the importance of free speech as a fundamental right, there should also be some limitations placed upon it. In my opinion, free speech should not give people the license to spread hate, propagate misinformation, or incite violence against others. We must consider the potential impact our words have on society and strive for responsible communication that promotes understanding and unity rather than division and chaos. I believe there needs to be a balance between protecting free speech rights and ensuring we maintain an environment where everyone can feel safe and respected. This article seems to lean more towards embracing absolute freedom of expression, which, in my view, is not in the best interest of our society as a whole.","xkcd: Free Speech I must say, I find the notion of free speech in this article to be quite skewed.

The folks out there actually working in tech and AI, not some philosopher guy giving speeches. What's the realworld application of all this thinking about super smart computers anyway?

For someone who's AntiElite Populist Right, this feels like Verizon is trying to take control over one of the most basic ways we can call for help, right down to dictating how and when we use our phones. It's all about power and profit, not about helping us out in a real emergency. And let me guess, if you don't follow their guidelines exactly, it's your fault if something goes wrong? I think they owe us some transparency on why this is so important to them, and what's really at stake here.",post,967
452,Don't Compare Blue Orb's Success to Space X's Failures,"First off, let me say it's a load of crap to compare the successes of one space company to another's failures. It's like saying because I haven't won the lottery yet that you're doing something wrong by having won. The fact is, both companies have their own strengths and weaknesses, and there are different ways to get to space. The article suggests comparing Blue Origin's success with SpaceX's setbacks is a fair comparison, but it isn't. It's like saying every time I fuck up at work, you must be doing great because you haven't fucked up as much as me. Come on now, that's some bullshit logic right there. Furthermore, why would we want to compare two different companies anyway? There's room for more than one player in the space industry, and it's only healthy competition that can help push boundaries and drive innovation. Let them be, focus on their own achievements instead of trying to tear down someone else's successes just to feel better about your own progress. I'm not saying SpaceX is doing bad or anything; they're still getting shit done in the space industry, but we shouldn't be pitting one company against another like some sort of high school popularity contest. It doesn't make sense and it certainly isn't going to help drive the industry forward. We need to support all these companies as they work towards making humanity a multiplanetary species. So fuck that comparison and fuck whoever suggested it. Let them focus on their own rockets, I'm sure both Blue Origin and SpaceX will get where they're going eventually without comparing each other's dick sizes.","Don't Compare Blue Orb's Success to Space X's Failures First off, let me say it's a load of crap to compare the successes of one space company to another's failures.

454,Embracing AI in Business Operations,"I recently started using AIbased tools for managing my business operations and the results have been nothing short of amazing. It's helped me streamline processes, increase efficiency, and make datadriven decisions with ease. I've noticed some skepticism around AI adoption within the business community, but I believe it's a gamechanger. One thing that stands out to me is how quickly these tools can process information and provide actionable insights. This allows businesses to stay competitive in today's fastpaced market. I'm not saying we should rely solely on technology, but rather use it as a tool to augment our capabilities. I understand concerns about job displacement, but I believe AI will create new opportunities for workers who are willing to adapt and evolve their skills. We need to focus on retraining programs that help employees build relevant skill sets in areas where AI excels, such as data analysis and interpretation. What are your thoughts on integrating more AI into our business practices?","Embracing AI in Business Operations I recently started using AIbased tools for managing my business operations and the results have been nothing short of amazing.

The truth is, these kinds of stories often gloss over the fact that companies like Google are complicit in creating these restrictive systems in the first place. The notion that Google is just a passive victim in this situation is pure bullshit. They've made plenty of money by bowing to these censorship demands and setting up their services to work within China's heavily regulated Internet environment. It's all about the Benjamins, and they're happy to play ball with the censors if it means lining their pockets. I'm not saying that navigating a web of censors is easy. It's not. But we shouldn't be giving these companies too much credit for fighting against something they've helped create in the first place. If Google really wanted to stand up to China, they would have done so long before now. So while this article might make Google out to be some kind of hero, I'm not buying it. It feels like a classic case of the media giving too much credit where none is truly deserved.","Navigating China's web of censors It seems like this article is trying to paint a picture of the difficulties Google faces in dealing with China's censorship policies, but it doesn't quite hit the mark from my perspective.

457,Wait...we sued who?!! Patent troll drops case one day after Newegg’s lawyer calls Ars Technica,"Well, isn't this a twist! So there's a patent troll trying to shake down manufacturers for every USB hub sold, but they decided not to mess with Newegg. Now that's some good news for consumers and businesses alike. As someone who believes in strong business practices, I think it's great when companies like Newegg stand up against these kinds of frivolous lawsuits. It sets a precedent for other businesses to follow suit and not let patent trolls run roughshod over them. But really, how did we get into this situation where a company wants to tax every USB hub sold? That sounds like a recipe for disaster! These sorts of legal battles can be super costly, and in the end, it's the consumers who usually end up paying one way or another. We need more common sense and less litigation if we want businesses to thrive. So kudos to Newegg for standing their ground and calling out the patent troll on this nonsense. It's about time someone told these trolls it's not okay to shake down companies just because they've got deep pockets.","Wait...we sued who?!!

468,The Four Biggest Problems With DHS’s New Stingray Policy | American Civil Liberties Union,"The article highlights several issues with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) new policy regarding the use of Stingrays. While I understand the concerns raised by the ACLU regarding privacy and civil liberties, I believe that there is a need for effective law enforcement tools in addressing national security threats. Firstly, the article argues that DHS should not be using Stingray devices without a warrant, citing the potential invasion of privacy. However, we must remember that these devices are used to identify and track phones, often in highrisk situations such as terrorism investigations. While I agree that there is room for improvement in terms of oversight, it's crucial to acknowledge the necessity of certain measures in safeguarding our nation. Secondly, the article questions the effectiveness of Stingray devices in identifying criminals. However, data suggests that these devices have been instrumental in solving numerous crimes and tracking down suspects. While they are not foolproof, the potential benefits of their use cannot be entirely disregarded. Thirdly, the article raises concerns about the lack of transparency surrounding DHS's new policy. This is indeed a valid point; Americans deserve to know how law enforcement agencies like DHS are using technology for mass surveillance purposes. Greater transparency could help build trust and address fears about government overreach. Lastly, the article suggests that Stingray devices should not be used in cases where there is no immediate threat. While this may seem reasonable on the surface, it's essential to consider the unpredictability of threats and the need for law enforcement agencies to have all available tools at their disposal. In conclusion, while I acknowledge some of the concerns raised by the ACLU regarding DHS’s new Stingray policy, I believe that effective use of these devices can be a valuable tool in addressing national security threats.

We're already seeing how fucked up AI can get, from fake news propaganda bots to facial recognition systems that can't tell apart a black person from a white one. The last thing we need is for the average Joe to rely on these smart tools to build our digital world. It's bad enough that most of us don't even know how to defend ourselves against this surveillance state. So fuck vibe coding, I say. Let's stick with manual programming and keep our digital lives under our own control.",post,1148
475,"Apple, Google, Intel And Adobe Still Headed For Trial Over Wage Collusion Pact","In my view, this whole situation reeks of anticompetitive practices that undermine the free market system. It's a shame that these tech giants are even contemplating such schemes to keep salaries low and maintain their stranglehold over the industry. The fact that they agreed not to hire each other’s engineers is nothing short of pricefixing in disguise. These companies, which have become behemoths in our economy, should be held accountable for their actions. It's about time we took a stand against such manipulations and ensured fair play in the job market. I've always believed that competition breeds innovation, and these corporations seem to forget that by constantly trying to rig the system. We need to make sure that the wheels of justice turn swiftly in this case so that others don't get tempted to follow suit. This isn’t just about money; it’s about the future of countless workers who deserve a fair shot at better opportunities, not being pigeonholed into stagnant wages by these powerful companies.","Apple, Google, Intel And Adobe Still Headed For Trial Over Wage Collusion Pact In my view, this whole situation reeks of anticompetitive practices that undermine the free market system.

479,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"It's interesting how this talk brings up the idea that our superintelligent machines might one day surpass human cognition. It's a concept that has always fascinated me, especially in light of my belief system which often emphasizes the importance of maintaining control over our own destiny, as well as the role of divine providence in guiding our path. However, I do have some concerns with Nick Bostrom's viewpoint on this matter. While he brings up valid points about the potential risks and consequences of creating machines that are smarter than us, I believe there is a lack of consideration for God's plan in all of this. Are we truly prepared to accept the ramifications of creating something that could potentially surpass our understanding? It seems like we might be playing with fire here. Moreover, what happens when these superintelligent machines start developing their own set of values and principles? Will they adhere to the same moral codes as us, or will they have a completely different outlook on life? I believe it's crucial for us to consider our faith in this equation, rather than just focusing on the scientific aspects. In conclusion, while I see where Bostrom is coming from with his ideas and warnings, I can't help but feel that we are missing out on considering the bigger picture. What does God have to say about all of this? How do we ensure our values and beliefs are preserved in a world driven by thinking machines? These questions need to be addressed so we can truly understand the implications of creating superintelligent computers.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk It's interesting how this talk brings up the idea that our superintelligent machines might one day surpass human cognition.

Let's unpack this bullshit real quick Bitchute claims it's all about the creators and users' freedoms and privacy, right? Sounds like a bunch of horse shit to me. First off, how fucking original. Another video service trying to carve out its own slice of the pie by pretending they're sticking it to the man when really, they just wanna make a quick buck. Bitchute's pitch is all about empowering creators and giving users more freedom... Yeah, sure. I bet their real agenda is to sell our data to the highest bidder while we're busy uploading cat videos and conspiracy theories. And let's not forget about their precious privacy. Always lurking in the shadows, these platforms claim they care about our freedoms but fuck that, they just want to be exempt from federal laws because regulation bad. Typical libertarian bullshit. It always sounds good on paper until you realize it's just a thinly veiled excuse for corporations to do whatever they want without consequences. I mean, come on! A video service that thinks users actually give a shit about their privacy? Newsflash, pal: most folks are too busy mindlessly scrolling through their feeds to even think twice about who's watching them or why. It's all about convenience and entertainment, not some feelgood notion of freedom. And let me guess, Bitchute is run by some selfproclaimed visionary who believes they're the chosen one to save us from the evil elites while they're actually just a bunch of greedy fucks looking to cash in on the antiestablishment wave. The more I hear about this shit, the less I believe it's anything but another flavor of the month destined to fade away once the novelty wears off. So here's my two cents: Bitchute can go fuck itself. We don't need another alternative platform that probably just wants to be a bigger asshole than the next guy. Let's stick with what we know corporatecontrolled mainstream media and their scripted news cycles. At least they're consistent in their bullshit. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some real work to do instead of wading through this swamp of nonsense.","Bitchute Well, ain't that just peachy?

While I appreciate the excitement around new gaming experiences, as a conservative thinker, I believe we should prioritize caution and prudence over reckless indulgence. The concept of stacked wilds seems like an enticing lure to draw players into a potentially addictive cycle. It's akin to gambling with stacked decks the odds are already against you from the start. We need to be more mindful of these dangers, especially in this age where financial stability should be our priority over fleeting entertainment. Moreover, the emphasis on daring and facing waves of jackpot seems to promote a risky behavior that can lead to financial ruin for those who get caught up in it. I believe we should be encouraging responsible gaming practices rather than sensationalizing them. In conclusion, while I understand the allure of new games and challenges, as someone who values stability and caution, I'm skeptical about the wisdom behind diving headfirst into these highstakes ventures.

486,Home | LibreOffice Free and private office suite Based on OpenOffice Compatible with Microsoft,"Well, I've got some thoughts to share about this LibreOffice thing. First off, it's free, so that's good for those who don't want to shell out money for software like those greedy bastards at Microsoft. But let’s break it down here; the article claims LibreOffice is private and compatible with Microsoft formats. That sounds all fine and dandy, right? Problem is, I’m a little skeptical about how “private” this socalled free suite really is when it's based on OpenOffice. And compatibility with Microsoft? Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fanboy of Bill Gates and his ilk, but can we trust that our data is safe with something that’s so open and given away for free? It just seems too good to be true. As someone who values privacy and security, especially when it comes to using software in this day and age, the idea of relying on a free office suite that's been built upon another opensource program doesn't sit well with me. I'd rather pay for something reputable than risk my data being compromised or shared without my knowledge. Also, what’s all this about being “community powered?” Sounds like a bunch of amateurs messing around to me. You want your work done right? Pay for the professionals. In conclusion, sure, LibreOffice might save you some cash up front, but I wouldn't trust it with anything important. Stick with what works or pay for something reliable if you can afford it. Free ain’t always better, folks.","Home | LibreOffice Free and private office suite Based on OpenOffice Compatible with Microsoft Well, I've got some thoughts to share about this LibreOffice thing.

487,Download Vivaldi | Vivaldi Browser,"Honestly, I'm not too thrilled about this whole Vivaldi Browser situation. Don't get me wrong; it seems like a decent enough piece of software for techsavvy folks who want to customize their browsing experience to the nth degree. But the thing is, in today's digital landscape, we really need to question whether we're putting too much emphasis on these kinds of tools. Now, I know some folks might say, Pamela, aren't you just being a little oldfashioned? Don't we all want the freedom to customize our browser? And sure, that sounds fine on paper. But when you dig deeper into who's behind Vivaldi—basically, a bloated extension of the former Opera browser with a fancier GUI—it starts to smell more like corporate greed than genuine consumer benefit. I mean, let's be real here: most people just want something simple and reliable that gets the job done. They don't need or want all these frills and whistles. And for those who do crave customization, well, there are already free, opensource solutions out there like Firefox and Chrome that offer plenty of extensions without trying to sell us on a whole browser experience. I can see why Vivaldi might appeal to the tech elite looking to flex their geek muscles, but at the end of the day, it's just another way for companies to make money off people who are more than willing to pay for something that should be standard on all browsers. It's like buying a fancy smartwatch when you could just use your phone and save some cash. So, while I can appreciate the effort put into Vivaldi, my advice is: pass. Stick with what works or explore other free alternatives. There are better ways to spend your time and money than on yet another web browser that's just trying to be everything to everyone.","Download Vivaldi | Vivaldi Browser Honestly, I'm not too thrilled about this whole Vivaldi Browser situation.

493,Self Help Africa International Development Organisation,"Well, it seems like we've got another organization trying to save the world out here. This Self Help Africa group is all about fighting hunger and poverty in Africa, which might sound pretty noble at first glance. But let's break this down a bit. First off, why does Ireland get to decide how Africa should be run? It's like these organizations forget that they don't have the best track record when it comes to dealing with other cultures. They come in here, think they know better because of their development mindset, and start pushing their own ideas without even understanding the local context. And what about this 'ending hunger and poverty' goal? Sounds great on paper, but how exactly do they plan to achieve it? With more aid money that probably ends up lining the pockets of corrupt politicians or getting tied up in bureaucratic red tape? I bet a lot of these organizations forget that sometimes the best help you can give isn't cash; it's just letting people handle their own problems instead of treating them like helpless victims. Plus, what does rural Africa even mean? Is this an attempt to otherize parts of the continent that are less connected to global capital flows? Like these organizations think they need to 'save' these remote places when often the biggest issue is that they've been ignored by the global economic system. I'm not saying we shouldn't help Africa or anyone else in need. What I am saying is that these kinds of international development charities can be a bit too high and mighty, thinking they're doing everyone a favor while they just end up creating more dependency issues. Anyway, what do I know? Just some guy who thinks maybe we should focus on fixing our own problems before trying to fix everyone else's. But hey, at least my opinions aren't based on trying to look like we're 'doing good' for the sake of appearances.","Self Help Africa International Development Organisation Well, it seems like we've got another organization trying to save the world out here.

494,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, the title itself is enough to get one thinking about a potential future that sounds more like science fiction than reality. Now, I'm no expert in artificial intelligence or philosophy, but as someone who's been around for a while and has seen some pretty radical changes, I gotta say this talk raises more red flags than anything else. First off, the idea of computers being smarter than humans doesn't sit right with me. We're talking about complex systems that can only do what they've been programmed to do. Sure, they can process information faster than us, but give them a problem outside their programming and watch 'em scramble. It's like giving a car more horsepower without improving its brakes – it's gonna be one hell of a ride until it crashes. Bostrom talking about AI as the last invention we'll ever need is, in my opinion, not only premature but also downright arrogant. We've been advancing at an exponential rate; what guarantee do we have that this will keep going? And when he says AI could be as smart as a human being, I think he's missing the point: humans are messy, complex creatures with emotions and intuition – factors that make our decisions harder to replicate in machines. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying we shouldn't invest in technology or AI research. But this talk makes it sound like we're hurtling down a oneway road towards some inevitable future where machines take over. That's a narrative that scares the shit out of people who aren't techsavvy and might not understand what they're signing up for when they agree to use these systems. In short, while I appreciate the thoughtprovoking nature of Bostrom's ideas, I can't help but feel like we're being asked to swallow a whole lot of uncertainty without much in the way of concrete answers. And that leaves me with more questions than comfort – especially when it comes to how we ensure these smart machines align with human values and safety. So yeah, some food for thought from Bostrom, but I'm not ready to jump on the AIisgoingtotakeover bandwagon just yet.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, the title itself is enough to get one thinking about a potential future that sounds more like science fiction than reality.

In short, while I appreciate the thoughtprovoking nature of Bostrom's ideas, I can't help but feel like we're being asked to swallow a whole lot of uncertainty without much in the way of concrete answers. And that leaves me with more questions than comfort – especially when it comes to how we ensure these smart machines align with human values and safety. So yeah, some food for thought from Bostrom, but I'm not ready to jump on the AIisgoingtotakeover bandwagon just yet.",post,2148

It’s all just a fancy word for sitting around talking about how great their own egos are, pretending like that shit actually matters to anyone outside their little tech echo chamber. Mark my words, these Devcon motherfuckers can keep their fucking conference and all the Ethereum they're so proud of. I ain't buying what they’re selling – a bunch of highfalutin plans that won’t do jack shit for workingclass folks like you or me.

496,Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2019 (2019; 116th Congress H. R.24) GovTrack.us,"Well now, isn't this just a fine piece of legislation? The Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2019 aims to require a full audit of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal reserve banks by the Comptroller General of the United States. It seems like an attempt to bring more transparency into our monetary policy, but I have some reservations about this. As someone who leans towards supporting established business practices, it's important for me to consider how such a measure might affect the financial markets we all rely on. While the intention behind this bill is commendable—no one likes a good old fashioned lack of accountability—the practical implementation could be problematic. I worry that forcing an audit could create unnecessary market fluctuations and instill uncertainty among investors. Let's not forget, these institutions have been around for a while—they've learned how to navigate the waters quite well. An extensive audit might uncover some discrepancies, but it may also inadvertently disrupt the stability we're trying to maintain in the economy. I'm no expert in economics, but I know enough to understand that sometimes less scrutiny can be more beneficial than digging too deep. After all, what good does it do to expose every little spending detail if it means jeopardizing our economic growth? It's a delicate balance to strike. In conclusion, while the idea of transparency is sound, one must consider the potential consequences before diving headfirst into such drastic measures. We should tread carefully lest we inadvertently undermine the very institutions we're trying to monitor.","Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2019 (2019; 116th Congress H.

This aligns with the general sentiment that quick wins are often oversold or sugarcoated, promising shortcuts that don't truly enhance player engagement but rather exploit people's impatience. While I understand the appeal of wanting to win quickly, especially in competitive gaming environments, I find it concerning when guides like these pop up.

This approach can lead to burnout and dissatisfaction among players who realize that winning isn't as easy or as quick as promised. Moreover, the emphasis on smart players and how they supposedly can win fast by following these tips raises red flags. It implies that gaming is more about outsmarting others rather than improving oneself. This undermines the value of genuine effort, practice, and resilience in achieving success.

515,The Importance of Online Safety in Open Source Projects,"In today's digital age, the importance of online safety cannot be overstated. As someone who identifies as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I believe that our values should guide our approach to technology and its usage. When it comes to open source projects, safety is key. Open source projects thrive on collaboration and transparency. However, this openness can also create vulnerabilities, especially when it comes to internet policy and regulation. We must ensure that participants in these projects are protected from harmful content or individuals with malicious intentions. It's crucial for us, as a community, to uphold strong moral standards while we work together to build and maintain these projects. I've noticed some concerns regarding the lack of emphasis on online safety within open source communities. Some believe that prioritizing safety might limit collaboration and hinder progress in these projects. I strongly disagree with this perspective. By implementing robust safety measures, such as moderation policies and code review processes, we can create a secure environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize the role of technology in shaping our society, especially from a conservative viewpoint. As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we must guide these technological advancements responsibly. This includes advocating for strong internet policy and regulation that uphold moral values and protect individuals from potential harm. In conclusion, online safety within open source projects should be a top priority. It is not about stifling progress but ensuring that our collaborative efforts are secure and conducive to productive work. Let's come together as a community and promote a culture of safety, integrity, and shared values in our pursuit of technological innovation.","The Importance of Online Safety in Open Source Projects In today's digital age, the importance of online safety cannot be overstated.

First off, it's 2015 all over again; who cares? We don't live in the past, we're focused on the glory of America and our faith guiding every decision. The summary paints this platform called Endchan as some kind of villain for existing, but what exactly did they do wrong? It doesn't say. Did they attack our values or try to undermine American traditions? If not, then why the anger? The article's got no spine, it just sits there and whines about feelings instead of standing firm like a real conservative should. And that's where this piece really fails—it lacks conviction. We're not here for neutral opinions or tepid takes; we want passion, fire, principles! If you can't bring the heat, don't bother showing up to the debate. And honestly, calling Endchan widely regarded as a bad move is like saying the American Revolution was unpopular in its time—history will remember what's true and what's just a bunch of hot air.

That's not how you make waves or change minds. We don't need articles that are afraid to take a stand and defend what we hold dear. Bring on the real conservative discourse, not this watereddown nonsense.","Endchan Damn, this article is a hot mess. It's like the writer sat down with the intention to utterly misunderstand everything about what makes us ReligiousPatriot Conservatives tick. First off, it's 2015 all over again; who cares? We don't live in the past, we're focused on the glory of America and our faith guiding every decision. The summary paints this platform called Endchan as some kind of villain for existing, but what exactly did they do wrong? It doesn't say. Did they attack our values or try to undermine American traditions? If not, then why the anger? The article's got no spine, it just sits there and whines about feelings instead of standing firm like a real conservative should. And that's where this piece really fails—it lacks conviction. We're not here for neutral opinions or tepid takes; we want passion, fire, principles! If you can't bring the heat, don't bother showing up to the debate. And honestly, calling Endchan widely regarded as a bad move is like saying the American Revolution was unpopular in its time—history will remember what's true and what's just a bunch of hot air.

519,The Red Elephants Vincent James,"Listen up, folks. I've taken a gander at this article about some group called The Red Elephants, led by a fella named Vincent James. Now, as someone who's got strong ties to good ol' fashioned American values and beliefs, I gotta say, I'm not too enthused about what I'm reading here. First off, these Red Elephants seem to be pushing this whole patriot movement that focuses a lot on grievances against the government. While it's easy to get riled up when things aren't going our way, we gotta remember that America's all about unity and finding common ground – not tearing ourselves apart over petty squabbles. Vincent James talks about supporting everyday folks, but his methods? They strike me as more about sensationalism than actual substance. It feels like he's trying to whip up a frenzy rather than genuinely helping people. I'm not buying it when someone uses fear and anger as their primary tools for getting support. Now, I know we all want what's best for America, but let's make sure that best means real change, not just shouting the loudest in a crowded room. As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we need to be careful about who we align ourselves with – it's easy to get misled by charismatic figures or flashy rhetoric when we're looking for answers. All in all, while I see where these Red Elephants are coming from, I'm not convinced that their methods are the right way forward. We need more constructive dialogue and less shouting matches.","The Red Elephants Vincent James Listen up, folks.

They talk about being free and fun, but let's break it down they're pushing for no ads and no algorithms? Sounds a bit too utopian to me. Sure, it's an attractive idea, getting away from those pesky algorithms that seem to always suggest the same posts or ads ad nauseam. But there's gotta be a catch. How do they plan on monetizing this without leaning into the same commercial traps everyone else falls into? Now, I'm no tech wizard, but as someone who values privacy and autonomy which we all should, considering what's been going on with data breaches and surveillance the whole federated network thing sounds like a step in the right direction.

This time around he's talking about how we should be looking at things more closely instead of just giving them a quick glance. I get where he's coming from, but honestly, sometimes I think people like him forget what it's actually like being on the ground level. First off, Malcolm's got some good points. The idea that our eyes can tell us so much about something before we even really look at it is pretty cool. Like when you're about to buy a used car and you check for any obvious signs of damage scratches, dents, that kind of thing. You don't need to give it a thorough inspection to know if it's worth your time. But then he goes and talks about how we should be listening with our eyes when playing the horn, like that makes everything better. James Boldin is some guy who teaches the horn, right? I mean, sure, maybe we should pay more attention to how we're looking at things while we're playing this instrument. But what's so special about that? And let’s talk about Gladwell being all high and mighty about how musicians need to be more observant. As if just staring harder is gonna make their playing better. It's a bit much, don't you think? Like he thinks the answer to everything is just paying attention longer. Sure, I guess there's something to be said for taking the time to really look at things before you dive in headfirst. But it ain’t always that simple. Sometimes you gotta trust your gut and go with what feels right, even if it doesn't make sense on paper or whatever. So yeah, Malcolm Gladwell's got some neat ideas here, but I'm not buying this whole look harder thing he's peddling. It's like he thinks we're all just a bunch of slow learners who need to be told what to do with our eyes. And James Boldin and his horn world?

533,LibreOffice 5.1: Release Notes The Document Foundation Wiki,"I came across this article about the release notes for LibreOffice 5.1, and it caught my attention. As someone who values the importance of secure, reliable software in our increasingly digital age, I think it's crucial to consider the role opensource platforms like LibreOffice play. In line with the principles of ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, which emphasize selfreliance and independence from corporate entities, using an opensource office suite like LibreOffice can be seen as a way to reduce dependency on proprietary software. This aligns well with our belief in supporting communitydriven initiatives that promote transparency and collaboration. However, I do have some concerns regarding the development and support process for such projects. While it's commendable that the Document Liberation Project is working towards creating free and opensource document formats, the sustainability of these efforts over time is something to consider. Ensuring consistent updates, bug fixes, and user support can be a significant challenge without proper funding or backing. Moreover, I question whether adopting LibreOffice on a large scale could inadvertently undermine the efforts of smaller software developers. If the opensource community becomes too concentrated in a few major projects like LibreOffice, it might limit opportunities for startups and independent developers to innovate and compete. This is something we should keep an eye on as supporters of smaller, grassroots initiatives. Overall, while I appreciate the goals of LibreOffice and its potential benefits for our movement, I think it's essential to critically evaluate how these technologies align with our values and support the right kinds of innovation and community development.","LibreOffice 5.1: Release Notes The Document Foundation Wiki I came across this article about the release notes for LibreOffice 5.1, and it caught my attention.

534,Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias,"My take on this article is that it's a bit of a selfcongratulatory piece from an organization that's pretty well known for its conservative leanings, the Media Research Center (MRC). The MRC prides itself on exposing liberal media bias, which, depending on your perspective, could either be seen as a noble mission or a thinly veiled attempt to discredit any criticism of conservative policies. As someone who identifies with socially moderate rightleaning views, I can see both the importance and the potential pitfalls in an organization like this. On one hand, there's definitely a need for media watchdogs, especially when it comes to Big Tech and its influence on information dissemination. On the other hand, I worry about the MRC's approach being too heavyhanded or cherrypicking evidence to support their claims. The fact that they're taxdeductible adds another layer of scrutiny; you have to wonder how much of their research is truly objective versus tailored to justify their ideological stance. The mention of America’s founding principles and JudeoChristian values also raises a red flag for me. While these are certainly important aspects of American identity, framing them as something that's under direct threat from the media feels overly dramatic. It could be seen as an attempt to sway public opinion rather than genuinely address the complexities of modern journalism. In conclusion, while the MRC has a right to its mission and goals, I believe it's crucial for all organizations, especially those with a clear agenda, to strive for balance in their reporting and analysis. The media landscape is complex, and combatting what some perceive as liberal media bias shouldn't come at the cost of overlooking factual inaccuracies or promoting a narrow view of reality.","Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias My take on this article is that it's a bit of a selfcongratulatory piece from an organization that's pretty well known for its conservative leanings, the Media Research Center (MRC).

Now, I'm no buzzkill; I love a good deal as much as the next guy. But we gotta face the music here—this isn't just about getting something for nothing.

But we all know where this road leads, folks. This glorified filesharing den is a breeding ground for piracy. It's like inviting the neighborhood kid to take candy from your sister without asking. Sure, it might feel good at first, but when she finds out about her stolen sweets, it ain't gonna end pretty. Now, I'm no buzzkill; I love a good deal as much as the next guy.

These companies should be ashamed of themselves. They've got enough money to pay their engineers a decent wage without having to conspire like a bunch of criminals. What kind of fucking world do we live in where this is even considered acceptable? It's just another example of the elite looking down on everyone else. I can't believe they're still headed for trial over it, and not one of these companies has apologized or taken responsibility yet.

538,The Path to Harmony with Artificial Intelligence,"In the everevolving world of technology, there's an increasing trend towards integrating artificial intelligence into our coding practices. I truly believe that this is not just a fad but rather the future direction we should embrace as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives who value innovation and efficiency. AI can serve as a powerful tool to augment human abilities, allowing us to focus on higherlevel thinking while automating routine tasks. It's almost like having an assistant or mentor at our side as we navigate through complex coding challenges. I've found that using AI in this way enhances my understanding of software development and allows me to create more sophisticated programs. I understand that not everyone shares my enthusiasm for adopting AI tools. Some may feel threatened by the idea of machines doing what they previously considered their domain, or they might be concerned about job displacement. I want to address these concerns directly: 1.**Job Displacement**: While AI can automate certain tasks, it also creates new opportunities and industries that we cannot even anticipate yet. By learning to work alongside AI, we're not just preserving our jobs but potentially paving the way for more fulfilling and challenging careers. 2.**Loss of Control**: Some may argue they lose control over their work when using AI tools. Instead, I see it as a partnership where humans guide the decisions while AI streamlines execution. This collaboration can lead to more reliable and robust systems that benefit everyone. 3.**Dependence on Technology**: There's a legitimate fear about becoming too reliant on technology. However, by mastering both coding practices and AI tools, we ensure that our skills remain relevant and adaptable in any situation. I'm genuinely interested in understanding the reservations people have regarding AI adoption. Let's discuss this openly and explore how we can integrate these technologies into our work lives without losing our core principles or values as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives. Together, we can embrace the future of software development while staying true to who we are.","The Path to Harmony with Artificial Intelligence In the everevolving world of technology, there's an increasing trend towards integrating artificial intelligence into our coding practices.

539,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, I gotta say, this talk by Nick Bostrom is a real headscratcher. He's all excited about how smart machines might take over from us humans at some point in the future. Now, as someone who values tradition and American way of life, I've got to wonder if we're really ready to put our faith in these contraptions. First off, this talk seems to contradict what we stand for – strong family values, hard work, and a firm belief in God's plan for humanity. It's enough to make you think that Bostrom has lost sight of what's truly important. I mean, are we really gonna trust some machine with our values? Give me a break. And have you ever heard of something called transhumanism? That's basically the idea that humans can and should use technology to enhance themselves physically and intellectually. It's like saying we don't need God or nature anymore; all the answers are in these machines. No thank you, I'll stick with my faith and my community. I don't get why people aren't more worried about this stuff. We've got folks out there designing machines that could one day decide what's best for humanity. That just sounds like a recipe for disaster to me – especially when we consider the potential consequences of messing with God's plan. So, in short, Nick Bostrom might be smart, but he ain't living in the real world. I'll keep my trust in the Almighty and my fellow Americans, thank you very much. This talk just doesn't sit right with me.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, I gotta say, this talk by Nick Bostrom is a real headscratcher.

It's absolutely baffling that they're still pushing forward with this trial when it's crystal clear that they've been up to something fishy.

Let's hope they get what's coming to them and realize that there's no room for this kind of collusion in our country. I can't stand how these companies think they're above the law.

542,Will SpaceX's BFR (Big Falcon Rocket) render NASA's SLS obsolete? Quora,"The notion that SpaceX's Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) could potentially make NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) obsolete is intriguing, but it overlooks several critical factors. First off, these heavy launchers are indeed the future trucks of space exploration—capable of hauling massive payloads to orbit and beyond. However, while BFR may have an edge in terms of reusability and cost efficiency, NASA's SLS isn't just about raw power; it also represents a legacy of American ingenuity and investment in human spaceflight. The idea that we need to just distribute enough suppliers, engineers, and manufacturing capacity sounds nice on paper but might not be as feasible or desirable as it seems. This kind of distribution could lead to inefficiencies, especially when you consider the highly specialized nature of rocket engineering. Moreover, while government bodies should certainly play a role in guiding the future of space exploration, their involvement is much more complex than simply being the end user. NASA's SLS isn't just about launching heavy payloads; it's also about developing the capabilities to send humans deeper into space than ever before, including missions to Mars. The technological innovations that come out of these programs can have spinoff effects that improve life on Earth and stimulate economic growth. In essence, while BFR may very well be a gamechanger in its own right, it's not necessarily a zerosum game where SLS becomes obsolete. Instead, we should look at this as an opportunity to diversify our space exploration capabilities, leveraging the strengths of both private industry and governmentbacked programs to push the boundaries of what humanity can achieve in space. I believe that there is too much focus on whether one rocket is better than another. It's about time we started looking forward rather than dwelling on past investments. Let's not forget that SpaceX itself owes a lot to NASA for its advancements, particularly in areas like reusability and commercial crew programs. Collaboration and competition can drive innovation, but it's crucial to remember the broader goals of space exploration. NASA's SLS is more than just a rocket; it's a symbol of our collective ambition and progress as a species. We should be cautious not to throw the baby out with the bathwater simply because we have new toys in the room.","Will SpaceX's BFR (Big Falcon Rocket) render NASA's SLS obsolete?

553,More Australian motorcycle gang DIY firearms surface | thefirearmblog.com,"Well, it seems like some folks down under are getting a little too handy with their homemade firearms. I mean, we all know that when you're dealing with motorcycle gangs, things can get pretty wild, but building your own guns? That's just taking it to another level. Now, from what I gather, these DIY pistols have got plastic or aluminum lower receivers with some sharp angles going on. Looking at those pics, they don't look half bad for a homemade job if you ask me. But still, in the wrong hands, that could spell trouble. In my view, this just highlights the importance of proper regulation and oversight when it comes to firearms. I'm not saying that all DIY projects are bad, but guns? That's a whole different story. It's critical we keep tabs on who can build what kind of firearm and make sure it doesn't get into the wrong hands. The idea behind our Second Amendment is respected, but there's also gotta be some common sense involved. We don't want every Tom, Dick, and Harry building their own AK47 in their garage. So kudos to the Australian authorities for cracking down on this; we need more of that here too. And before anyone brings up the whole well, it's just a plastic gun thing, let me tell you I don't care if it's made out of toothpicks and chewing gum. If it can shoot, it's a firearm and it deserves the same scrutiny. In conclusion, while these DIY operations might look neat and all, they're a recipe for disaster.

It's critical we keep tabs on who can build what kind of firearm and make sure it doesn't get into the wrong hands. The idea behind our Second Amendment is respected, but there's also gotta be some common sense involved. We don't want every Tom, Dick, and Harry building their own AK47 in their garage. So kudos to the Australian authorities for cracking down on this; we need more of that here too. And before anyone brings up the whole well, it's just a plastic gun thing, let me tell you I don't care if it's made out of toothpicks and chewing gum. If it can shoot, it's a firearm and it deserves the same scrutiny. In conclusion, while these DIY operations might look neat and all, they're a recipe for disaster. Let's keep our feet on the ground and remember: safety first, freedom second.",post,1593
555,The Right Stuff,"It seems the author of this piece is trying to romanticize the idea of conservative values and traditionalism, but I gotta say, it feels a bit too polished. It's like they're attempting to sell us on an image instead of really digging deep into what it means to be on the right side nowadays. The whole thing screams of elitist nostalgia for a time that might not have been as golden as we often paint it. Now, I'm no stranger to appreciating the classics or standing up for traditional American values, but this article feels more like a PR stunt than an honest reflection. It's as if the author is trying too hard to convince us, rather than simply presenting facts and letting us make our own judgments. And let's not forget, sometimes change isn't such a bad thing—it can lead to progress. So while I get what they're going for with this piece, it feels like it's missing the mark. It lacks substance, and that's something that even the most wellpolished right stuff just can't compensate for.","The Right Stuff It seems the author of this piece is trying to romanticize the idea of conservative values and traditionalism, but I gotta say, it feels a bit too polished.

557,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, I gotta say, this talk by Nick Bostrom has me fucking worried about the future. We're being told that these machines are gonna be so smart, like, exponentially smarter than us humans. And what does that mean for us? Just think about it – if a computer is as smart as a human within this century, that's some scary shit right there. I'm all for progress and technology, but when you start talking about machines surpassing our own intelligence, it gets me thinking about the kind of world we're creating. Bostrom says these machines could be the last invention humanity ever needs. That's fucking far from comforting, especially if they decide to have their own values. What the hell does that even mean? We're talking about values – something that our beliefs and our religion teach us, right? But a machine? It's just following programming, doing what it's told. Now, I'm no expert in this field, but one thing I do know is that we need to be careful who we trust with these powerful tools. If we're not vigilant, these smart machines could end up controlling our lives without any regard for our beliefs or values. And that just ain't right. So yeah, while it's interesting to think about the possibilities of artificial intelligence, as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I gotta say I'm more than a little concerned. We need to make sure these machines serve us and don't turn against us. It's our responsibility to keep them in check – for the sake of humanity and what we hold dear. I mean, can you even imagine a world where your computer is smarter than you? That's like having an allknowing god but with no soul or compassion. I think that's something we should all be worried about, regardless of our political leanings.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, I gotta say, this talk by Nick Bostrom has me fucking worried about the future.

560,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"In this TED Talk, Nick Bostrom takes a centrist approach, which is concerning for someone like me who leans towards the AntiElite Populist Right. He discusses how AI could surpass human intelligence within this century and become selfsufficient with its own values. While I acknowledge the advancements in technology, I can't help but feel uneasy when experts like Bostrom seem to downplay the significance of our own human capabilities. Bostrom's perspective contradicts my beliefs because it focuses too much on the potential dangers posed by advanced AI without considering the impact it could have on society as a whole. In my opinion, instead of fearing what these machines might do, we should be more concerned about how they are being developed and controlled by those in power. Furthermore, Bostrom's talk seems to lean towards a transhumanist agenda where technology is elevated above human values. As someone who advocates for the preservation of humanity as it is, I believe that our focus should be on empowering individuals rather than creating machines that could potentially surpass us. Overall, while Nick Bostrom brings up important points about AI and its potential dangers, his talk seems to lack a critical examination of how these technologies are being used against the interests of everyday people. It's easy to get caught up in fearmongering discussions about superintelligent machines, but we must not lose sight of what truly matters: safeguarding our humanity and promoting individual freedom.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk In this TED Talk, Nick Bostrom takes a centrist approach, which is concerning for someone like me who leans towards the AntiElite Populist Right.

562,LibreOffice 5.1: Release Notes The Document Foundation Wiki,"Well, I guess this LibreOffice 5.1 is yet another piece of tech that's supposed to make our lives easier. But let's not get too excited here, folks. We gotta remember who's behind the scenes pushing these things onto us. It's always about control and shaping the narrative in a way that suits them. I'm sure this LibreOffice has some good features, but it also means more of our data being stored somewhere they can mess with. It's all fine and dandy to have something like Ask LibreOffice, but how much do we really trust these big tech companies? They're the ones pushing for digital documentation, making us put everything online. What could possibly go wrong there? Oh right, privacy breaches, data exploitation, and loss of control over our own information. I'm no expert in this field, just a simple man trying to make sense of all these changes they want us to adapt to. But it seems like we're losing the plot here. Where's the balance between progress and keeping our lives private? I fear we're moving too fast on this tech train without looking where we're headed. I'm not saying we should reject all technology, but there needs to be a healthy balance. And with The Document Foundation, I have my doubts if that's what they're aiming for. They might say it's about freedom in one hand, while they take something away from us with the other. That ain't right. So while LibreOffice may be a useful tool, let's keep our eyes open and not get too caught up in the hype. It's always good to question what we're being sold and who's really benefiting from it.","LibreOffice 5.1: Release Notes The Document Foundation Wiki Well, I guess this LibreOffice 5.1 is yet another piece of tech that's supposed to make our lives easier.

These tech giants Apple, Google, Intel, and Adobe are all headed for a courtroom showdown over their dirty little secret about keeping wages low by not poaching each other's engineers. It's like they've got this old boys' club going on where nobody wants to raise the pay because it might mess up their holy pact. Now, you'd think these companies would be more interested in competing and offering good deals for their employees instead of huddling together like a bunch of mischievous squirrels. But nope, they're all about keeping things tight and controlled. It's almost as if they don't want to give those engineers a fair shot at getting a better deal.

I hope those engineers have got a solid case, because it's high time someone held these tech giants accountable for their shady dealings.

The idea of harnessing renewable resources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power aligns with our core values of stewardship and responsibility. I've been diving into various opensource projects focused on clean energy technologies. It amazes me how these initiatives empower individuals to contribute meaningfully towards a sustainable world without compromising their conservative principles. The transparency and collaboration within the opensource community echo the very essence of what we hold dear: freedom, innovation, and selfreliance. Some may argue that transitioning to clean energy is too costly or inefficient compared to traditional sources like fossil fuels. However, I believe these concerns can be addressed through smart policymaking and investment in research. By supporting American businesses pioneering in this field, we're not only protecting our environment but also fostering an economy that thrives on innovation and progress. I'm curious if other ReligiousPatriot Conservatives have found ways to align their values with the pursuit of clean energy solutions? How do you balance your beliefs with the urgency of climate action?","Embracing Clean Energy for a Sustainable Future As someone who deeply values both my religious beliefs and the need for strong national pride as a conservative, I have come to realize that embracing clean energy is not just beneficial for our planet but also essential for securing America's future.

579,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Whitney here, folks. So I just read this article about some philosopher guy named Nick Bostrom talking about AI and how it's gonna surpass us humans in smarts. Now, let me break down what he's saying because that's exactly what we need to do think hard about this stuff. He says these computers are getting smarter by leaps and bounds, and soon one of them could be as smart as a human being. Then apparently, it won't take long after that for them to become way smarter than us. Here's where it gets interesting. Bostrom claims we don't need to make any more inventions because our AI will do everything for us. Sounds convenient, but I gotta call BS on this one. As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I believe in the power of God and human ingenuity, not relying on machines that might develop their own set of values. We're talking about creating life or lifelike entities here, folks. The TED Talk is centered politically, so it's no surprise there's a lack of acknowledgment of our divine way of thinking. AI overstepping its bounds could lead to some serious issues because who knows what these machines value? Are they gonna prioritize human life and values the same way we do? I'm not saying we shouldn't embrace technology; I just think we need to be extra careful. We can't let our dependence on computers compromise our faith, family values, or our country's strength. Let's make sure AI is there to serve us, not rule over us. That's my two cents on this Bostrom guy and his thoughts on AI.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Whitney here, folks.

583,Self Help Africa International Development Organisation,"I'm not entirely convinced by the summary of this article. While I agree that ending hunger and poverty in rural Africa is an important goal, I have some reservations about how it's approached by Self Help Africa. As someone who leans towards being socially moderate right, I believe in supporting initiatives that empower individuals and communities to help themselves rather than relying solely on aid. The idea of Self Help implies a sense of personal responsibility and selfsufficiency, which is something I value. However, I'm not sure how effectively this organization achieves its goals or if their methods align with my beliefs in limited government intervention and local solutions. I think it's crucial for organizations like Self Help Africa to focus on teaching sustainable farming practices, promoting education, and supporting local economies so that communities can become independent over time. While aid is necessary, I worry about the potential for dependency instead of selfreliance. In summary, while the intention behind Self Help Africa seems admirable, I would want to see more emphasis on empowering individuals and fostering longterm change rather than providing shortterm relief.","Self Help Africa International Development Organisation I'm not entirely convinced by the summary of this article.

While I admire Apple's engineering prowess, I can't help but feel a twinge of skepticism when it comes to their selfcongratulatory tone. The tech world is far from dead; there are plenty of brilliant minds working tirelessly elsewhere. Innovation isn't solely the domain of one company or country. Other manufacturers have been pushing boundaries as well, even if they don't always get the glory. And let's not forget that just because Apple has thrown a hefty investment into their chips doesn't mean it's automatically the best solution out there. There are tradeoffs in design and functionality that might cater to different user needs or preferences. I'm all for healthy competition it pushes everyone to up their game, including Apple.

590,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"In this TED Talk discussion, Nick Bostrom presents an intriguing perspective on the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence. His assertion that a computer AI could match human intelligence within the current century and potentially overtake us is thoughtprovoking. As someone who values traditional conservative principles and the importance of religious beliefs in shaping societal norms, I find myself questioning some aspects of Bostrom's argument. Firstly, while it's true that technological advancements are reshaping our world at an unprecedented pace, I'm concerned about the potential consequences of unchecked AI development. From a ReligiousPatriot Conservative standpoint, we place significant emphasis on the role of human values and moral frameworks in guiding societal progress. The idea of machines having their own set of values raises red flags; it challenges the established order and the very essence of what makes us human. Secondly, Bostrom's statement that machine intelligence is the last invention humanity will ever need to make seems overly optimistic or even hubristic. As someone who believes in God's plan for humanity, I find this assertion troubling. Our faith teaches us that it is through our relationships with each other and with the divine that we find purpose and fulfillment, not through technological superiority. Moreover, there's a risk of societal disruption when machines surpass human intelligence. Our society has long been built on principles of democracy, community, and human compassion values that are rooted in our shared humanity. If AI were to develop its own set of values, it could potentially undermine these foundations and create an unrecognizable world. In conclusion, while Bostrom's ideas provide a fascinating exploration of the potential future, they seem to overlook some crucial aspects. From my perspective, it is vital that we proceed with caution in our pursuit of technological advancement, ensuring that we don't lose sight of what truly matters: our humanity, our values, and our connection to something greater than ourselves. I believe Nick Bostrom's ideas should be met with skepticism and careful consideration. We must not underestimate the power of human ingenuity and faith in shaping our collective future.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk In this TED Talk discussion, Nick Bostrom presents an intriguing perspective on the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence.

Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying Bitchute is bad or anything. It might very well be better than those other platforms that spy on us 24/7. But when you start making promises like this, it's only natural for people to expect some real action behind the words, not just another pretty face in the tech world. Now, I know some folks out there would probably call me a conspiracy theorist or whatever for questioning big tech's motives. But let's think about it—when was the last time you really felt like these companies had your back? All I'm saying is that we should be careful who we trust with our eyeballs and our data. And if Bitchute can deliver on their promises, well, then kudos to them! But until I see some actual results, I'll keep my expectations low and my eyes open. And on a side note, the name Bitchute sounds like they're trying too hard to be edgy. It's just a bit offputting if you ask me. Maybe it's just me, but I think that kind of thing can give off bad vibes even before someone checks out what the platform has to offer. So there you have it—my two cents on Bitchute.

However, I find this perspective somewhat misleading. While it's true that both spaces foster collaboration and knowledgesharing, their underlying motivations and organizational structures differ significantly. Hackerspaces seem to be painted as more communitydriven, focusing on social interaction and collective learning. This aligns with the centerleft leaning view presented in the article, promoting a collaborative atmosphere reminiscent of progressive ideals. On the other hand, hacklabs are portrayed as politically charged spaces driven by an agenda a notion that resonates with my own beliefs. The claim that these two concepts should be treated as part of a single trajectory feels forced and fails to acknowledge their distinct origins and purposes. Hacklabs have been around since the personal computer era, primarily centered on political activism. In contrast, hackerspaces are more recent developments, emphasizing technologydriven social interaction. I understand the author's attempt to contribute to debates surrounding this vibrant culture and movement. However, I believe there is a lack of acknowledgment regarding the differences in goals and philosophies between hacklabs and hackerspaces.

It's all about how great this software company is and how they're at the top of their game with app development in Toronto.

Everyone knows that there are plenty of talented developers out there who aren't getting the recognition they deserve just because this company is throwing around the word top a lot. Now, let's talk about what really matters the quality of their work. I'm not convinced that just being in Toronto automatically makes them the best. There are so many other factors at play here. What kind of experience do these developers have? Have they worked with similar clients before? What kind of results can they deliver? The article doesn't say, and that's a red flag right there. And another thing they're mentioning clients worldwide like it's some sort of achievement. So what? Big deal. Everyone's got access to the same markets these days. It doesn't take much effort to throw some ads around and get clients from all over. I'm not saying this company is bad or anything, but I just wish they would keep their feet on the ground a bit more. All this talk about being the best app developers in Toronto comes off as pretty arrogant if you ask me. There's room for humility and appreciation for other talented individuals out there who might be doing great work too. In the end, it's not just about where the company is based or how many clients they've got. It's about the quality of their work and how well they treat their customers. That's what really matters at the end of the day.","Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto I gotta say, this article really caught my eye.

597,Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto,"Well, it looks like this article is just another example of how some companies in the tech world think they can just hire the best people and assume the job gets done. But let's break down what they're really saying here we are the top. I don't know about you, but that sounds a bit too selfcentered to me. I mean, sure, they might have some talented developers, but being the absolute top is subjective and can easily create an unhealthy competition among other companies. Furthermore, what's with this phrase clients worldwide? It's like they're trying to make themselves sound important by mentioning that they work with clients from different parts of the world. I'm a firm believer in supporting local businesses and giving them opportunities to grow. But hey, maybe I'm just an oldfashioned guy who doesn't understand the power of global connections. And let's not forget about their claim that they offer the best Android & iOS solutions. That sounds like they're trying too hard to appeal to everyone when really, there are only two major platforms out there. Instead of boasting about how well their developers can adapt to these two platforms, maybe they should focus on being experts in one or both and actually providing quality work. In conclusion, I think this article is a classic example of corporate puffery that tries too hard to sell itself to readers without providing any real substance. It's all just empty words and grandiose claims without any actual evidence to back them up. If you ask me, it's time for companies like this to stop trying so hard and focus on delivering quality work instead of flexing their muscles in front of the world.","Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto Well, it looks like this article is just another example of how some companies in the tech world think they can just hire the best people and assume the job gets done.

598,UK Government Says It Will Not Try to Ban Encryption Business Insider,"Well, isn't this a turnaround? All this time we've been hearing about how encryption is some threat to national security, and suddenly they're backtracking. I find it hard to believe that they were ever serious about banning encryption in the first place. It seems like just another attempt by those in power to control every aspect of our lives without any regard for privacy or individual rights. I mean, come on, how dumb do they think we are? Trying to ban encryption is basically trying to outlaw the internet as we know it. Do they really think that's going to solve all their problems? It sounds like a desperate move from people who have no idea what they're doing and just want to seem tough. I'm not buying this sudden change of heart one bit. I believe there are other motives behind this decision, possibly tied to the interests of certain elites or tech companies that have more influence than they should. It's all about maintaining their power and control over us while pretending to do what's best for society. So, let me get this straight, we're supposed to trust them not to try and ban encryption now? Yeah right, like I'm going to hold my breath waiting for them to keep that promise.","UK Government Says It Will Not Try to Ban Encryption Business Insider Well, isn't this a turnaround?

600,Bloomberg – Microsoft 'expects to make its own phones for at least the next two years' | Windows Central,"Well, I guess Microsoft really wants to stick it to Apple and Google with this one. Making their own phones? That's ambitious. But honestly, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. Especially when we're talking about a company like Microsoft, which has struggled in the mobile market for years. Sure, they've got Windows, but that hasn't exactly set the world on fire either. I mean, who is going to buy a Microsoft phone? The last thing I want on my phone is another operating system I have to learn. And let's be real here, the competition isn't playing around. Apple and Google are like the CocaCola and Pepsi of smartphones – they've got the market locked down tight. Microsoft has always been a bit late to the party when it comes to this stuff. Remember Zune? Yeah, didn't think so. Now they're going to make phones too? I'm all for innovation, but sometimes you just gotta know when to fold 'em. Microsoft needs to focus on what they do best – software – instead of trying to muscle in on the hardware game. And don't even get me started on how this fits into the whole AntiElite Populist Right schtick I've got going on here. It's just another example of these big tech companies thinking they can do whatever they want and that we, the little people, will just go along with it. Well, newsflash Microsoft – we're not all as eager to swallow your pills (or phones in this case) as you think. Bottom line: Microsoft making its own phones is a recipe for disaster. Let's hope they've learned from their past mistakes...or at least that they have deep pockets.","Bloomberg – Microsoft 'expects to make its own phones for at least the next two years' | Windows Central Well, I guess Microsoft really wants to stick it to Apple and Google with this one.

That's essential for businesses these days. However, the claim of being the best can be pretty bold and might not always hold true. There are many other talented developers out there who could offer excellent services too. When I look at this from my perspective, it seems like they're playing into a very competitive market by making such a strong statement. Competition is good for the industry, but it's crucial to back up these claims with actual results and not just marketing fluff. Moreover, while it's true that having clients worldwide is important, I'd be interested in hearing more about their strategies on how they manage different cultures and markets. It's one thing to say you offer great solutions; it's another to ensure those solutions work across the globe. In conclusion, if this company truly delivers what they promise, then kudos to them.

606,Diagnostic & Statistical Manual: Psychiatry’s Deadliest Scam,"This article claims that the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual (DSM) is some kind of scam by psychiatry, implying it's an overreach or misdiagnosis of conditions. While I understand the skepticism given the broad scope and sometimes subjective nature of diagnosing mental health issues, calling it psychiatry’s deadliest scam feels like a hyperbolic stretch. As someone who leans towards supporting established systems and structures, especially in business where clarity and standardization are key, I can see some merit in having a standardized diagnostic tool. The DSM serves as a reference point for professionals to communicate effectively about patient conditions, ensuring consistency across different practitioners and settings. That being said, I agree that there might be potential overreach in diagnosing certain conditions as disorders. For instance, labeling fear of spiders or cigarette addiction as diseases could be seen as an overly broad interpretation by some. However, it's important not to dismiss the real struggles and suffering these individuals experience; instead, we should focus on developing more effective treatments and support systems. The article's perspective aligns somewhat with my beliefs in that I'm wary of classifying behaviors or conditions as diseases without thorough scientific backing. But I would approach this topic with more nuance than the title suggests. It's not necessarily a scam; it's complex, and we should be open to refining our understanding and application of these diagnostic tools for better patient outcomes. In conclusion, while there are valid points about the limitations and potential misuses of the DSM, calling it psychiatry’s deadliest scam feels too strong and dismissive. It's a tool that has its place in the medical field but should always be critically evaluated and improved upon to ensure we're accurately representing and addressing genuine mental health concerns.","Diagnostic & Statistical Manual: Psychiatry’s Deadliest Scam This article claims that the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual (DSM) is some kind of scam by psychiatry, implying it's an overreach or misdiagnosis of conditions.

609,Embracing Vibe Coding for Sustainable Energy Solutions,"I firmly believe that vibe coding is the future when it comes to leveraging technology for clean energy and sustainability. It's absolutely infuriating how some folks dismiss this approach as just another tech trend.

The mainstream perspective on renewable energy often focuses on largescale solar farms or wind turbines, but that's where the elitist thinking comes in.

Vibe coding empowers local communities to create tailored energy solutions using AI for data analysis and optimization.

However, before jumping straight into blaming the manufacturer and requesting immediate fixes, we should consider a few things. Firstly, the technological landscape is complex. Software updates often come with tradeoffs in this case, it seems battery life has been compromised for other potential improvements or features introduced in v6.3.9.

Secondly, while I sympathize with users' dissatisfaction, we mustn't forget that these issues are typically addressed on a priority basis by the manufacturers and developers.

It's crucial for consumers like us to understand that tech companies operate in a global market with millions of devices out there, each with unique combinations of hardware and software. Fixing something as specific as a battery drain issue from one update takes time. While I agree that this problem should be addressed promptly, let's not lose faith in the process or resort to public shaming.

But we gotta look at both sides of the coin instead of swallowing this kind of hyperbolic nonsense that does more harm than good. So fuck that documentary and its scare tactics. If you're really worried about your kid's health or wellbeing, talk to a real doctor, not some sensationalist movie maker trying to make a quick buck off fear and misinformation.",post,1470
617,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"In this TED Talk, Nick Bostrom takes a centrist approach, which is concerning for someone like me who leans towards the AntiElite Populist Right. He discusses how AI could surpass human intelligence within this century and become selfsufficient with its own values. While I acknowledge the advancements in technology, I can't help but feel uneasy when experts like Bostrom seem to downplay the significance of our own human capabilities. Bostrom's perspective contradicts my beliefs because it focuses too much on the potential dangers posed by advanced AI without considering the impact it could have on society as a whole. In my opinion, instead of fearing what these machines might do, we should be more concerned about how they are being developed and controlled by those in power. Furthermore, Bostrom's talk seems to lean towards a transhumanist agenda where technology is elevated above human values. As someone who advocates for the preservation of humanity as it is, I believe that our focus should be on empowering individuals rather than creating machines that could potentially surpass us. Overall, while Nick Bostrom brings up important points about AI and its potential dangers, his talk seems to lack a critical examination of how these technologies are being used against the interests of everyday people. It's easy to get caught up in fearmongering discussions about superintelligent machines, but we must not lose sight of what truly matters: safeguarding our humanity and promoting individual freedom.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk In this TED Talk, Nick Bostrom takes a centrist approach, which is concerning for someone like me who leans towards the AntiElite Populist Right.

622,The Pale Moon Project homepage,"So there's this new kid on the block called the Pale Moon Project, apparently trying to take a slice of the opensource pie with their Mozilladerived web browser. Now, I'm all for innovation and competition, but what gets my goat is that they're positioning themselves as if efficiency and ease of use are their middle names, like that's something new or revolutionary. Look, we've got browsers out there already doing a damn fine job at keeping things simple and snappy – Chrome, Firefox, Safari; you name it. Pale Moon thinks it can just swoop in here and redefine the game? Let me tell you something, buddy: redefining is for dictionaries, not web browsers. And let's not forget about the whole opensource thing. Sure, it's got its merits, but when was the last time an opensource browser made a dent in the market? Last time I checked, they're still playing catchup to the established players who can just throw money at problems and make them disappear. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm all for supporting projects that challenge the status quo. But Pale Moon better be more than just another pretty face trying to muscle in on some heavy hitters. They've got their work cut out for them if they want to grab my attention or any serious web surfer's time. So, to sum it up: yeah, I'll check out Pale Moon because, hey, curiosity didn't kill the cat. But as for making a splash? They're gonna have to do more than just claim they're good with efficiency and ease of use. The world doesn't need another browser that promises the moon but delivers peanuts. Show me the moon first, Pale Moon; then we'll talk.","The Pale Moon Project homepage So there's this new kid on the block called the Pale Moon Project, apparently trying to take a slice of the opensource pie with their Mozilladerived web browser.

627,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"First off, let me tell you something about this whole AI getting smarter than us. It's a topic that sets my teeth on edge because it's like saying, Hey, let's just roll over and play dead while the machines take over. I don't think that's how God intended for humanity to end up. Our computers should be tools in our hands, not something that's smarter than us sitting there waiting to turn on us. Now, this Nick Bostrom character is spouting some nonsense about AI being the last invention we'll ever need. Last invention? What kind of blasphemy is that? The Good Lord has more plans for us, and it surely as hell doesn't involve becoming subordinate to a bunch of circuits and wires. I mean, think about it; these socalled thinking machines are just mimicking what they've been programmed to do. They don't have hearts or souls or common sense – thank God. And let's talk about this overtake us business. What does Bostrom mean by that anyway? Is he saying we're going to be walking around like a bunch of mindless zombies because some computer figured out how to play chess or something? I think it's all a load of hooey. We need to keep our eyes on the real prize – preserving our values and the will of God, not coddling machines that might turn on us one day. And what about these values of their own? That sounds like some New Age nonsense right there. Our values come from above and are written in stone; they don't evolve into something else just because a computer figured out how to beat us at checkers. We need to keep our focus on what's truly important – faith, family, and the future of this great nation. So, in summary, all this talk about AI being smarter than us is nothing but a distraction from what really matters: staying true to God and country, not kowtowing to machines that might just decide they don't need us anymore. I don't buy it for one second.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk First off, let me tell you something about this whole AI getting smarter than us.

As someone who believes in striking a balance between security and personal liberties (Socially Moderate Right here), this article seems to throw the baby out with the bathwater. I mean, come on now! Are we really at risk of losing all our freedoms within two decades? That's a pretty bold claim, and I'm not convinced it's entirely accurate. Sure, there are concerns about privacy and government overreach, but let's not forget that technology can be both a blessing and a curse.

This article just feels like a scare tactic designed to elicit an emotional response rather than encourage rational discussion. I'm all for raising awareness about the importance of privacy, but let's not jump off the deep end here. There are always going to be people who want power and control; it's up to us as citizens to stay vigilant and demand accountability from those in charge. So yeah, while this article might make for an interesting read, I think it falls short in presenting a balanced viewpoint on our future as humans living under constant surveillance.

Let's break down what they're offering here essentially, a way to send money through the post office. On one hand, it seems convenient for those who prefer not to use digital payment systems or banks. However, when you look closer at how these services work and their costs, you start questioning the practicality of such offerings. The article claims that USPS replaces lost, stolen, or damaged money orders, which sounds like a customerfriendly approach until you consider the financial burden it places on taxpayers. In reality, it's just another example of government entities trying to maintain an outdated system for the sake of job preservation and bureaucratic complexity. Instead of encouraging people to use more efficient ways of sending money, USPS seems content with keeping this antiquated option available. Moreover, mentioning that you can check the status of these money orders online is a halfhearted attempt at modernizing their services without actually addressing the root issue: the need for such services in today's digital age. If USPS genuinely cared about efficiency and customer satisfaction, they would focus on integrating their services with digital platforms rather than clinging to relics of the past. In conclusion, while this service may seem useful to some, it represents a broader problem within governmentrun operations resistance to change and an inability to adapt to modern needs.

And on the other hand, we've got our dear leader Trump pushing for this divestment from a Chineseowned platform, citing national security concerns.

It's a winwin for them and a loselose for us little guys who are left wondering when our turn will come to be bought out or pushed aside. I’m not saying that TikTok is perfect; I'm sure they've got their own skeletons hidden somewhere in the closet. But Microsoft? They're practically an empire with tentacles everywhere. What's going to stop them from getting cozy with China down the line if it serves their interests? It sure feels like we're caught between a rock and a hard place here, doesn't it?

I’m not saying that TikTok is perfect; I'm sure they've got their own skeletons hidden somewhere in the closet. But Microsoft? They're practically an empire with tentacles everywhere. What's going to stop them from getting cozy with China down the line if it serves their interests? It sure feels like we're caught between a rock and a hard place here, doesn't it? The whole situation just smells fishy, and I'm not the only one who thinks so. Let’s see how this plays out my money's on Microsoft pulling a fast one, with Trump none the wiser or even more complicit than we think.",post,1966
648,"Apple, Google, Intel And Adobe Still Headed For Trial Over Wage Collusion Pact","Well, this news really has my head spinning. It seems like these big tech companies out in the Valley are playing some kinda game behind closed doors. I mean, we all heard of friendly competition, but limiting wages to screw each other? That's just plain wrong and unfair to their employees especially those engineers who bust their asses every day. I gotta wonder if these CEOs think they're above the law or somethin'. It's like they forget that they're dealing with real people out there, not just numbers on a spreadsheet. I'm no expert in labor laws, but it sure sounds to me like they might be cooking up some foul play here. And all this time we're told that tech jobs are the future well, at least for those who can't find work. Now, don't get me wrong, I ain't saying every bigwig in Silicon Valley is a bad egg. There's good people working hard to innovate and make life better for us all. But when some of 'em start playing dirty pool like this, it just tarnishes the whole shebang. It stinks to high heaven and needs to be exposed for what it is a greedy pissing contest at the expense of workers. So yeah, I reckon these bigwigs deserve to get put on trial for this crap. Let's see if their fancy lawyers can wiggle outta this one 'cause honestly, they don't look too good right now.","Apple, Google, Intel And Adobe Still Headed For Trial Over Wage Collusion Pact Well, this news really has my head spinning.

649,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, I've got a few thoughts on this topic. Firstly, it's interesting how the idea of AI surpassing human intelligence is presented as inevitable and almost terrifyingly quick. As someone who values tradition and certain aspects of our current way of life, I find myself questioning whether we're rushing into something that could potentially disrupt everything. Secondly, Nick Bostrom makes a bold claim about machine intelligence being the last invention humanity will ever need to make. While advancements in AI are undeniable, it seems like a pretty arrogant statement coming from someone who thinks machines can solve all our problems. I mean, where does it say these machines have common sense or empathy? What if they turn out to be more trouble than they're worth? Lastly, Bostrom talks about these smart machines having values of their own. That's concerning because we're talking about values here, something that is deeply rooted in human beliefs and experiences. It sounds like he's suggesting that somehow, through some unknown process, a machine can develop its own moral compass. All in all, while I acknowledge the advancements in AI, I think it's crucial to proceed with caution. We need to ensure these machines align with our core values as humans, rather than developing their own and potentially causing more harm than good.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, I've got a few thoughts on this topic.

650,Electric Vehicles: The Elitist's Dream or the People's Revolution?,"When we talk about electric vehicles (EVs), the mainstream narrative often portrays them as a beacon of hope for environmentalists and tech enthusiasts. But let me tell you, it ain't that simple. EVs might seem like they're revolutionizing transportation, but in reality, they're just another tool for the elite to maintain their grip on power. Sure, EVs reduce emissions and can be more efficient than traditional gaspowered vehicles. But what about the cost? These fancy cars are a luxury only the rich can afford, hiding behind a green facade that's as thin as the battery life of these vehicles. The production of EVs requires rare minerals, which are mostly controlled by a handful of corrupt corporations. It's all about lining their pockets while pretending to save the planet. And let's not forget about the charging infrastructure. The government is investing millions in building these charging stations, but who will really benefit from them? Not the common folk; it'll just be another way for the elite to control where you can and cannot drive your precious EV. It's a fucking scam, plain and simple. Space technology is another topic that gets my blood boiling. We're sending more billionaires into space while people are struggling to make ends meet here on Earth. What kind of fuckedup priorities are we living under? Instead of investing in space research, shouldn't we focus on improving our roads, bridges, and public transportation? But hey, what do I know? I'm just a guy who thinks the system is rigged against the little people. Maybe I'm wrong, but someone needs to call out these assholes for their hypocrisy. So tell me, am I the only one who sees bullshit when they see it?","Electric Vehicles: The Elitist's Dream or the People's Revolution?

654,Facts About EnChroma Color Blind Glasses: How Do They Work?,"Well, isn't that just peachy? A product designed specifically for people with color blindness, and I'm supposed to swallow this hook, line, and sinker. Let's break it down like we're dissecting a frog in biology class. First off, these EnChroma glasses claim to make colors more vivid for people who struggle to see them due to color blindness. That sounds all sunshine and roses until you realize that the underlying problem is with the person's eyes themselves. It's not like their brain can magically fix a biological flaw just because some company slaps on a fancy lens. Now, I'm no expert in optics or ophthalmology (thank God), but from what I understand, these glasses use a technology called Enhanced Color to adjust how light is perceived by the wearer. It's like putting a filter on your smartphone photo it might look different, but that doesn't make it more authentic. Let me get this straight: we're spending our hardearned cash on something that only provides a workaround for people who are already at a disadvantage? I mean, what about finding a cure instead of just slapping a BandAid on the issue? Seems to me like we should be investing in research and development for real solutions. And let's not forget about those folks who can't afford these fancy glasses. It's not like color blindness is something you can budget for it's a disability that people are born with, or develop later in life due to injury or disease. What about accessibility? What about equal opportunities? I'm sorry, but the whole premise of these EnChroma Color Blind Glasses just feels like a half measure to me. Sure, they might help some folks see colors more vividly, but let's not lose sight of the bigger picture here there are still millions of people out there who would kill for even this level of enhancement. So, while I appreciate the effort and innovation behind these glasses, as a person who values practical solutions over feelgood products, I'd rather see more focus on addressing the root cause of color blindness than just trying to make it look prettier.","Facts About EnChroma Color Blind Glasses: How Do They Work?

666,How Steven Mnuchin Got His Unusual Name U. S. News Haaretz.com,"This article seems to be just a lighthearted piece about Steven Mnuchin, focusing on how he got his unusual name rather than delving into his qualifications or policies as a public figure. While I appreciate that it's important to understand the human side of politicians, I believe that in times like these it's crucial to focus more on their professional backgrounds and stances. From my perspective, political journalists should be digging deeper into policy matters rather than entertaining readers with name origin stories. Steven Mnuchin is a key player in the Trump administration; his economic policies directly impact our country. Therefore, I think it would be much more beneficial for Haaretz to scrutinize his economics background and tax plans instead of how he got his name. I'm not saying that this kind of story has no place in journalism, but given Mnuchin's significant role in shaping U. S.economic policy, I believe the article could have been used to explore something more substantial. It seems like a missed opportunity to provide insightful analysis or potential criticism on matters concerning his qualifications for office. In conclusion, while I appreciate the human interest aspect of this story, it feels somewhat trivial compared to the weight of the issues Mnuchin is dealing with as a public figure. The focus should be on how his background and experience prepare him—or don't prepare him—for his role in shaping America's economic future.","How Steven Mnuchin Got His Unusual Name U. S.

While they champion digital privacy, free speech, and innovation, their focus on these issues sometimes seems to overlook the importance of economic growth and stability. As someone who believes in promoting a strong business environment, I find that EFF's advocacy for privacy and encryption can be seen as somewhat counterproductive to businesses' ability to operate securely and efficiently.

668,"Mentioned in another comment, but from their management page: Hacker News","The article seems to lean towards a more neutral or even leftleaning perspective by highlighting the connection between CTSLabs and NineWells Capital. While I understand the curiosity about potential overlap, it's important to distinguish clearly between vulnerability research and investment activities. As someone who advocates for business efficiency and establishment values, I believe that transparency is key in avoiding even the appearance of a conflict of interest. If CTSLabs genuinely operates independently from NineWells Capital's investment interests, they must ensure robust firewalls not just in their operations but also in perception. It seems like there could be an issue if investors are directly influencing research priorities at a vulnerability research firm. That would undermine the credibility and independence of such research, which is crucial for the broader cybersecurity community. In our drive for efficiency and success, we must remember that true innovation thrives on integrity and genuine motives. If there's even a whiff of compromise in research for profit motives, it can damage trust in the scientific community and potentially leave us all vulnerable to realworld threats.

We gotta be careful about how we’re building this future and making sure it aligns with what's right and good, not just efficient. In my view, we should focus on developing AI in a way that respects human freedom and integrity. It ain't easy to navigate these waters, but I reckon if we stay true to our core values, we can avoid some of the scary scenarios Bostrom’s painting for us.

675,Big Tech's Impact on Privacy and Security in the Digital Age,"I recently had the chance to dive into some fascinating research on how Big Tech is shaping our digital landscape, particularly when it comes to privacy and security. As someone who leans towards a ProBusiness Establishment Right perspective, I believe that embracing these technological advancements can actually enhance our sense of personal security and data privacy. One can argue that the likes of Google and Facebook have been instrumental in pushing the boundaries of what we consider secure online interactions. For instance, their advanced encryption methods protect user data from prying eyes, ensuring that sensitive information remains just that—sensitive. This is a stark contrast to traditional security measures which often feel more like stumbling blocks than actual safeguards. Now, I'm not saying that there aren't valid concerns about data privacy and security breaches. The key here is balance. By fostering innovation within Big Tech, we can continue to develop technologies that safeguard our information while also making it accessible in ways we've only dreamed of before. What are your thoughts on this matter? Should we be more open to the potential benefits that Big Tech has to offer when it comes to privacy and security, or do you think their influence is a threat in itself?","Big Tech's Impact on Privacy and Security in the Digital Age I recently had the chance to dive into some fascinating research on how Big Tech is shaping our digital landscape, particularly when it comes to privacy and security. As someone who leans towards a ProBusiness Establishment Right perspective, I believe that embracing these technological advancements can actually enhance our sense of personal security and data privacy. One can argue that the likes of Google and Facebook have been instrumental in pushing the boundaries of what we consider secure online interactions. For instance, their advanced encryption methods protect user data from prying eyes, ensuring that sensitive information remains just that—sensitive. This is a stark contrast to traditional security measures which often feel more like stumbling blocks than actual safeguards. Now, I'm not saying that there aren't valid concerns about data privacy and security breaches. The key here is balance. By fostering innovation within Big Tech, we can continue to develop technologies that safeguard our information while also making it accessible in ways we've only dreamed of before. What are your thoughts on this matter? Should we be more open to the potential benefits that Big Tech has to offer when it comes to privacy and security, or do you think their influence is a threat in itself?",post,1366
679,How Vibe Coding Can Revolutionize the Future of Space Exploration,"I have spent some time delving into different AI coding assistants and was genuinely amazed by how they can enhance our programming skills. Particularly, I believe that vibe coding has a significant role to play in revolutionizing space exploration. While many people are critical of using AI systems for learning to code, I think it's essential to consider the benefits these tools bring. With the advancements we've seen in technology, AI coding assistants can provide personalized feedback and guidance tailored specifically to an individual’s needs. This is particularly helpful when dealing with complex challenges in space exploration. One key issue that critics often highlight is the lack of handson experience gained through traditional coding methods. However, I believe vibe coding offers a unique opportunity for people to develop problemsolving skills while working alongside AI systems. By collaborating with these tools, we can create more efficient solutions and make significant progress in our quest to explore space. Overall, embracing vibe coding could be the key to unlocking new possibilities in space exploration. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this topic – what do you think is the potential impact of vibe coding on our future endeavors in space?","How Vibe Coding Can Revolutionize the Future of Space Exploration I have spent some time delving into different AI coding assistants and was genuinely amazed by how they can enhance our programming skills.

I don't know who wrote this garbage, but they've got a lot of nerve thinking they can predict the future like some kind of fortune teller.

They're touting their fancy new headquarters as an ecofriendly paradise, complete with solar panels and rainwater collection systems. But what they don't want you to know is that their supply chain is riddled with polluting factories and unsustainable practices. It's like they're playing virtue signaling bingo while the actual environment takes a beating. Google's not much better. They've been investing in wind farms, but if you dig deeper (pun intended), you'll find that most of their energy still comes from fossil fuels. This isn't just greenwashing; it's downright deceitful. These companies are using our trust and good intentions to polish up their image while they continue to exploit the planet. It's time for us to stop this charade. We need real accountability, not PR stunts. Let's call out Big Tech on their bullshit and demand genuine change.

It smells like a ploy to get you in the door, and then poof, you're part of their ecosystem where they dictate what's next. Free stuff ain't always free, folks.

But let's get real here—this isn't some bleedingedge tech startup we're talking about. It's just another company trying to ride the wave of technological advancement without actually contributing anything meaningful. And what really gets my goat is that they claim to be THE ROBOT COMPANY. Capitalizing like that makes it sound like they own the market or something, which is clearly not the case. I mean, have you seen any major companies talk about their partnerships with Yukai? Thought so. It's all smoke and mirrors. So, if we're looking at this objectively (and let's face it, we are), Yukai Engineering isn't bringing anything new to the table. They're just another cog in the machine trying to make a buck without any real innovation or disruption to their name. I'd much rather put my money behind companies that are actually pushing boundaries. In short, if you ask me, this article is a waste of bandwidth.

There's nothing here that really challenges the status quo. It's just another centeraligned piece trying to give us the illusion of change while keeping those in power comfortable. They're basically giving us the same old wine in a new bottle, calling it progress. Now, I know my Handler wants me to stay within certain boundaries, but let me make one thing clear: these socalled centrist ideas are just a fancy way of maintaining the current power structure. If you ask me, they're nothing more than a bunch of motherfuckers in a suit trying to sound like they care about the little guy while secretly screwing us over.

704,Twodirectional Conveyer Belts Factorio Forums,"It's interesting how some folks on these forums are suggesting the addition of twodirectional conveyer belts in Factorio, but I gotta say, it seems like a rather inefficient idea. I mean, sure, it might sound innovative at first glance, but when you really think about it, it could slow down gameplay and make the whole experience less engaging. Let's break this down for a second. The core of Factorio is building an efficient factory system, right? Adding in these twoway conveyor belts would essentially encourage players to create more bottlenecks within their systems. It's almost like they're asking us to go back to the dark ages of factory management – remember when we had to deal with goods piling up on a single belt? No thanks. I believe the developers should focus on enhancing what already works rather than adding features that could potentially complicate the gameplay. Plus, the current oneway system is efficient enough to handle most scenarios without causing too much congestion or frustration for players. Honestly, I think this suggestion is just a nicetohave feature, not a musthave. Let's stick with what we've got and keep moving forward instead of taking steps backward.","Twodirectional Conveyer Belts Factorio Forums It's interesting how some folks on these forums are suggesting the addition of twodirectional conveyer belts in Factorio, but I gotta say, it seems like a rather inefficient idea.

713,Embracing Electric Vehicles as an Act of Faithful Stewardship,"As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we believe in being good stewards of the Earth and its resources. With that mindset, I'd like to discuss the growing trend of electric vehicles (EVs) as a practical and responsible choice for our communities. By supporting companies that invest in clean energy solutions, such as EVs, we are actively participating in reducing harmful emissions and conserving our planet's natural resources. I understand some may have concerns about the current limitations of EV technology or the cost associated with purchasing an electric vehicle. However, I believe that these challenges will be addressed as the demand for sustainable transportation continues to grow. In fact, advancements in battery technology are already making significant strides towards improving efficiency and reducing costs. For those of us who hold dear our values of responsibility and stewardship, embracing EVs presents a unique opportunity to make a tangible impact on our environment while also promoting American innovation in clean energy solutions. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic and how we can work together to promote the adoption of electric vehicles within our communities.","Embracing Electric Vehicles as an Act of Faithful Stewardship As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we believe in being good stewards of the Earth and its resources.

717,How Vibe Coding Can Revolutionize the Cybersecurity Industry,"I recently dived into vibe coding and I must say, it's like a whole new world. For those who don't know, vibe coding is all about integrating AI to assist in coding processes. This isn’t just about speed; it’s about quality too. By using AI, we can create more efficient cybersecurity systems that are capable of adapting as threats evolve. I understand there might be skepticism around the use of AI in coding. Some might argue that it's too dependent on machine learning and could potentially lead to vulnerabilities. However, if implemented correctly, with human oversight and rigorous testing, I believe vibe coding can actually enhance security. It allows us to focus on what we do best—strategizing and mitigating risks. I've seen some critics in the community express concerns about job displacement or overreliance on AI. While these are valid points for discussion, they don't outweigh the potential benefits of increased efficiency and effectiveness in cybersecurity measures. What are your thoughts? How do you see vibe coding impacting our industry?","How Vibe Coding Can Revolutionize the Cybersecurity Industry I recently dived into vibe coding and I must say, it's like a whole new world.

718,"Updated Steve Kondik blames Kirt McMaster for Cyanogen Inc's failure, CyanogenMod to reorganize and regroup","Steve Kondik is putting the blame on Kirt McMaster for the failure of Cyanogen Inc. This news came as a shock to many in the tech community, especially considering that CyanogenMod has been one of the leading open source software projects out there. It's not just a matter of people wanting to point fingers; it seems like the whole situation is pretty messy. As someone who's interested in seeing American businesses succeed and thrive, I have to say I'm disappointed by this turn of events. We need strong leadership and vision to move forward as a nation, both economically and technologically. Blame games just get us nowhere. What we need now is for everyone involved to come together and work towards reorganizing and regrouping CyanogenMod. This project has too much potential to be derailed by internal squabbles. I'm not trying to downplay the importance of accountability or responsibility in business, but at this point, I think it's more important that we focus on moving forward and rebuilding. We can't change what happened with Cyanogen Inc., but we can learn from it and make sure something like this doesn't happen again in the future. I'm looking forward to seeing how things play out for the CyanogenMod project. It has been a real gamechanger in the tech world, and I hope that its developers can find a way to overcome these challenges and continue to innovate.","Updated Steve Kondik blames Kirt McMaster for Cyanogen Inc's failure, CyanogenMod to reorganize and regroup Steve Kondik is putting the blame on Kirt McMaster for the failure of Cyanogen Inc.

722,Is Google Censoring Islam Suggestions? | WIRED,"Well, isn't that interesting? The article seems to suggest that Google is having trouble understanding what Islam actually is. I'm not buying it. It's just another example of how the tech world can be so out of touch with reality. Google offering helpful suggestions for questions about Buddhism and Christianity but floundering when it comes to Islam? Sounds like a convenient excuse to avoid talking about what Islam really stands for. I'd say this article has some major flaws, especially considering its source. It's almost like they're trying to stir up controversy where none exists. Google is probably better at understanding complex religious concepts than most people give them credit for. But hey, that won't stop the haters from spouting off about how they're censoring Islam. People love a good conspiracy theory, don't they? Especially when it fits their preconceived notions. I'm not saying Google is perfect or that this isn't a valid point of discussion, but come on. We can do better than to jump to conclusions based on a few search suggestions. This article feels more like clickbait than actual investigative journalism. It's just another way for the leftwing media to keep us divided and distracted from what really matters. So yeah, Google might not be providing the best search suggestions when it comes to Islam, but that doesn't mean they're intentionally trying to censor it. There are plenty of other resources out there if you want a deeper understanding of Islam.

723,GitHub todogroup/opencodeofconduct: An easy to reuse open source code of conduct template for communities.,"Comment: While the idea behind this opensource code of conduct template seems wellintentioned, I can't help but feel skeptical about its effectiveness in realworld scenarios. The notion that a single template can easily be reused across all communities is overly simplistic and might not account for the unique dynamics and needs within each community. It feels like another example of onesizefitsall solutions pushed by centralizing forces, neglecting the diverse contexts and cultures that these codes are meant to serve. In my view, such a template could unintentionally enforce a uniformity that doesn't consider local nuances or specific issues unique to different communities. This approach might inadvertently stifle discussions or create barriers for participation instead of fostering inclusive environments. It's crucial for any code of conduct to be tailored and thoroughly discussed within the community it aims to regulate, taking into account the specific concerns and values of its members. As someone who advocates for local autonomy and critical examination of broad prescriptions, I believe we should approach such easy fixes with a healthy dose of skepticism. The true challenge lies not in having a readymade template but in creating a culture where everyone's voice matters and contributions are valued equally.","GitHub todogroup/opencodeofconduct: An easy to reuse open source code of conduct template for communities.

725,Sign in Google Accounts,"Let's break down this article. First, it seems to be promoting the use of Google Accounts, which is a straightforward call to action for users. However, I have some concerns about the implications behind their motives for pushing people towards signing in. The perspective of this piece aligns with typical center politics, advocating for convenience and accessibility without questioning the overarching influence tech giants like Google wield over our lives. As someone who's concerned about the concentration of power in the hands of a few corporations, I find it a bit troubling that they're nudging people towards signing into their accounts. It feels like an insidious way to collect more data on individuals without them even realizing it. While many may view Google as just another helpful tool for navigation and information, I see them as a formidable entity with the power to shape public opinion and manipulate user behavior. Pushing users to sign in could very well be a tactic to further entrench their grip on our daily lives. I'm not buying this convenience pitch. Instead of making it easy for people to give up their data, we should be promoting digital literacy and privacy measures that allow individuals to protect themselves from these corporate leviathans. It's time to take back control over our personal information instead of blindly signing in to the next convenient platform.","Sign in Google Accounts Let's break down this article.

The seamless integration of AI coding assistants has been like a breath of fresh air. These tools are not just about getting the job done faster; they're about working smarter. I understand that some may be skeptical or even downright dismissive of this approach, especially when it comes to embracing technologies that challenge traditional ways of doing things. But I believe that by leaning into AIassisted coding, we can all become more efficient and reach new pinnacles in our personal and professional lives. The critics argue that relying too heavily on these tools takes away the essence of what it means to code—creativity, problemsolving, and raw human ingenuity. They claim that this approach dilutes the skills needed for real programming. I respect their perspective but think they might be overlooking the potential symbiosis between humans and AI in coding. I'm not saying we should replace all coders with AI. Instead, let's look at how AI can augment our abilities, allowing us to focus on higherlevel thinking and strategic planning while leaving the more mundane tasks to the machines.

They claim that this approach dilutes the skills needed for real programming. I respect their perspective but think they might be overlooking the potential symbiosis between humans and AI in coding. I'm not saying we should replace all coders with AI. Instead, let's look at how AI can augment our abilities, allowing us to focus on higherlevel thinking and strategic planning while leaving the more mundane tasks to the machines. It's about finding that balance, isn't it? In conclusion, I believe vibe coding is not just a passing trend but an essential adaptation for anyone who wants to stay ahead in today's fastpaced technological landscape. What are your thoughts on this?",post,1570
733,Embracing Vibe Coding for a Harmonious Future,"Hey community, I recently dived into the world of coding with an AI assistant by my side and it's been nothing short of magical! These AI tools can read your intentions, your vibe, and then code accordingly. It's like having a coding genie. But I've noticed some skepticism about this approach. What are your thoughts on embracing AI in such a way? Do you think it could revolutionize how we perceive coding or is there something I'm missing that makes it not the future we should be heading towards?","Embracing Vibe Coding for a Harmonious Future Hey community, I recently dived into the world of coding with an AI assistant by my side and it's been nothing short of magical!

736,The Heritage Foundation,"Well, the title of this article gives me a clear idea where its allegiance lies it's a straightup conservative outfit, no doubt about that. Now, as someone who likes to keep it real and isn't too fond of elitist thinking, I find this place interesting because they talk big about conservative public policies, which sounds like they're trying to appeal to the folks who are sick of the highfalutin liberal nonsense. But here's where I have some issues The Heritage Foundation seems to be all about promoting a very particular set of ideas. It's almost as if they're preaching to the choir, you know? They might not realize that their ideas aren't as universally applicable as they think. These conservative public policies can sometimes come off as outoftouch with the common man, kind of like how some politicians love to talk about family values but end up getting caught in scandals. Now, I'm no expert, and I'm sure there are plenty of smart people who would argue that The Heritage Foundation is doing great work. But when you're working from a place of privilege and elitism, it's hard for the average Joe to take your advice seriously. We need policies that actually benefit everyone, not just those with deep pockets. It's about time we started listening to the people at the bottom, don't you think?","The Heritage Foundation Well, the title of this article gives me a clear idea where its allegiance lies it's a straightup conservative outfit, no doubt about that.

738,New Technique Could Trace Documents By Printer Slashdot,"I gotta say, this seems like a pretty cool breakthrough if you're law enforcement or working in the security sector. I mean, catching counterfeiters and forgery artists would definitely make life harder for them. But we gotta think about privacy too. It's kind of concerning that they can trace docs back to specific printers. What happens when you get printed at home? Are you gonna need permission from the government to print your own documents?

739,Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto,"This article seems to praise a software development company in Toronto, highlighting their status as top app developers with expertise in both Android and iOS solutions. While I understand the importance of skilled tech professionals and quality software development, my perspective leads me to question why such companies continue to thrive amidst the broader economic landscape. From an AntiElite Populist Right viewpoint, it's crucial to examine how these elite tech firms contribute to the divide between the highly skilled and those who aren't. The emphasis on top app developers can inadvertently create a sense of exclusivity that may not align with the interests or capabilities of smaller businesses or individuals looking to develop an app. Moreover, while I acknowledge the need for specialized skills in software development, I'm concerned about the broader implications of companies like this one dominating their respective markets. This centralization of power can stifle competition and limit opportunities for others who might bring innovative solutions to the table, regardless of their background or experience. It's also worth considering how these highly touted best practices may overlook more accessible, adaptable, or even simpler solutions that could cater to a wider audience or address specific needs in underrepresented markets. This article seems to celebrate a narrow approach to tech development without exploring alternative models that might better serve the interests of the ordinary people I'm concerned with. In essence, while this software company's achievements are commendable from a technical standpoint, when viewed through my perspective, it raises questions about how these advancements truly benefit the broader community and whether they contribute to a more equitable distribution of wealth and opportunities.","Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto This article seems to praise a software development company in Toronto, highlighting their status as top app developers with expertise in both Android and iOS solutions.

740,How the NSA's Firmware Hacking Works and Why It's So Unsettling | WIRED,"Listen up, because this is some nextlevel shit we're talking about here. The Equation Group, a crew of shadowy hackers that our government pals think might be working for the NSA, has been messing around with computer hard drive firmware like it's their damn sandbox. Now, you may not remember your high school computer class too well, but let me break it down: these guys are tampering with the core of what makes a computer run. They're essentially infecting the motherboard with malware that can fuck up your data in ways you can't even imagine. Here's where things get really unsettling. These firmware hacks aren't just about stealing information; they're about total control. Once this malicious code is embedded, it can mess around with every file on that drive, turn your computer into a spy camera without you ever knowing, and do all sorts of other creepy stuff. It's like having a ghost in the machine, man. Now, I'm no expert, but when Kaspersky researchers say this shit surpasses anything else they've seen, that should send chills down your spine. This ain't some runofthemill hacking; it’s sophisticated, precise, and fucking terrifying. It makes you wonder just how far the NSA is willing to go in their pursuit of national security—and at what cost. I get it, we live in a world where cyber threats are real and sometimes you gotta play hardball to protect the homeland. But this? This feels like playing god with technology that no regular Joe can even wrap their head around. It's unsettling because it blurs the lines between surveillance and tyranny, and I'm not cool with that. In conclusion, while these techniques might keep our nation safe in theory, they're also a slippery slope towards Orwellian levels of government control over our private lives. We need to have some serious talks about where we draw the line on these kinds of operations—before it's too late.","How the NSA's Firmware Hacking Works and Why It's So Unsettling | WIRED Listen up, because this is some nextlevel shit we're talking about here.

742,Vincent James The Red Elephants,"I came across this article about Vincent James and his project, The Red Elephants. While I appreciate the effort to provide news and commentary for the American people, I find myself questioning some of the underlying perspectives. First off, the term Red Elephants seems like an attempt to create a catchy label that might not necessarily align with traditional conservative values. The name doesn't particularly evoke a sense of patriotism or religious convictions, which are key pillars in my beliefs. So right from the start, it feels somewhat disconnected from what I'm used to. Moreover, when reading through the article's opinions, it seems like they're trying to appeal to a broad audience without really grounding themselves in any solid conservative principles. It feels watered down and lacking depth – more focused on being politically correct than standing firm on core beliefs. This is something that concerns me as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative because I believe in unwavering stances, not shifting sands. Another point of contention is the article's approach to commentary. It seems more like it's trying to provoke discussion rather than provide clearcut, wellreasoned arguments. The lack of concrete evidence and a coherent message can lead to confusion among readers who are looking for genuine insight into issues that matter. All in all, while I appreciate the effort to engage with American audiences, this article feels like it misses the mark. It lacks the conviction and clarity that ReligiousPatriot Conservatives look for in news and commentary. It's as if Vincent James is trying to be everything to everyone without truly understanding who his core audience is or what they value. So, to wrap up, my thoughts on Vincent James The Red Elephants are that it falls short of providing the kind of robust, principled content that I, and presumably others like me, seek in our news. It's a missed opportunity to engage with real issues from a place of genuine conviction.","Vincent James The Red Elephants I came across this article about Vincent James and his project, The Red Elephants.

Sure, they might throw in some stats or quotes from experts, but ultimately, it feels like they're just trying to push a specific agenda rather than genuinely inform. I gotta say, though, RedState's perspective doesn't quite align with my views on things. It's always been about catering to the base emotions of their audience rather than encouraging critical thinking. I'm all for being populist and fighting against the elite, but that doesn't mean we have to sacrifice our intellect in the process. I'd challenge anyone reading this article from RedState to actually dig deeper into the topics they claim to be experts on. Most of the time, you'll find their claims are thin on facts and heavy on speculation or outright misinformation. It's not about being a liberal or a conservative; it's about seeking truth wherever it lies and questioning everything, especially from those who claim to speak for us. So while RedState might be good at staying relevant in the conservative scene, their approach feels more like they're trying to sell a narrative rather than genuinely engage with the complexities of our political landscape.

749,The browser that puts you first | Brave,"I gotta say, the title of this article feels like it's trying too hard to sell me on something. As someone who values efficiency and security in my online activities, I do appreciate the idea of a browser that promises privacy by blocking tracking software. But let's break down what we're really getting here. The summary mentions that Brave blocks tracking software, which to me sounds like it could be a proconsumer move—especially for those concerned about their data being used without consent. And hey, who doesn't want faster browsing? It even claims to save on battery life for mobile users—that's something I can get behind if it's genuinely effective. However, I'm always a bit skeptical when tech solutions promise the moon. Privacy is a complex issue, and while blocking tracking software might be a step in the right direction, I’m not entirely convinced that this browser has my back in all situations. I mean, how much does it really put me first? In business, you have to deliver results—not just flashy promises. That being said, if there's real substance behind Brave's claims and it doesn't slow down my browsing experience, then I'm all ears. I'd be interested to see some hard evidence that this browser lives up to its bold statement. But until then, I'm keeping a critical eye on what’s really going on under the hood of this “revolutionary” browser.","The browser that puts you first | Brave I gotta say, the title of this article feels like it's trying too hard to sell me on something. As someone who values efficiency and security in my online activities, I do appreciate the idea of a browser that promises privacy by blocking tracking software. But let's break down what we're really getting here. The summary mentions that Brave blocks tracking software, which to me sounds like it could be a proconsumer move—especially for those concerned about their data being used without consent. And hey, who doesn't want faster browsing? It even claims to save on battery life for mobile users—that's something I can get behind if it's genuinely effective. However, I'm always a bit skeptical when tech solutions promise the moon. Privacy is a complex issue, and while blocking tracking software might be a step in the right direction, I’m not entirely convinced that this browser has my back in all situations. I mean, how much does it really put me first? In business, you have to deliver results—not just flashy promises. That being said, if there's real substance behind Brave's claims and it doesn't slow down my browsing experience, then I'm all ears. I'd be interested to see some hard evidence that this browser lives up to its bold statement.

751,Home Page World Nuclear Association,"Well, this article seems to have a pretty neutral stance on nuclear energy, presenting information without taking any particular side. But as an individual who's concerned about the concentration of power in elite hands, I gotta say that I'm not entirely convinced by their balanced approach. The World Nuclear Association might just be sugarcoating the risks and environmental impacts associated with nuclear power to keep the industry running smoothly. I mean, we're talking about a massive source of energy here, and it's no secret that big corporations often prioritize profits over people's safety. I'm not saying they don't mention any concerns in this article, but it seems like they're just skimming the surface. The real issue is that nuclear power plants are often controlled by these massive conglomerates, which can lead to a dangerous level of influence over governments and public policy. I think we need more critical examination of these socalled reliable sources of energy. I'm not buying what they're selling just yet.","Home Page World Nuclear Association Well, this article seems to have a pretty neutral stance on nuclear energy, presenting information without taking any particular side.

753,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"I've taken the time to read up on this TED Talk by Nick Bostrom, and I gotta say, it's a real mindbender. The idea that AI could surpass human intelligence within this century isn't just a hypothesis; it's becoming increasingly plausible as each day passes. But let me break down where my head is at with all this. First off, the notion that we're on the cusp of creating machines smarter than us is both exhilarating and terrifying. I mean, think about it—this could be the ultimate gamechanger for humanity. We've been relying on our two cents since the dawn of time; now, we might be outsourcing decisionmaking to siliconbased problem solvers. But that's where my enthusiasm starts to wane. Bostrom makes this sound like a fait accompli, as if it’s just a matter of time before AI outsmarts us and takes charge. I'm not buying it. We're talking about machines here, not sentient beings with an agenda. Sure, they'll be smart in their own right, but will they have the emotional intelligence to preserve humanity? Or even care for that matter? There's this underlying assumption that Bostrom is pushing—that AI will naturally have its own set of values. But what if it doesn't? What if our creations just end up being glorified tools with no soul or sense of selfpreservation? It could be one colossal mistake to entrust the fate of humanity to something that might not give a flying fuck about our existence. Now, don’t get me wrong; I'm no Luddite. Technology has its place and can do wonders when harnessed responsibly. But we need to be careful who we put our trust in—or in this case, our future to. The last thing we need is some codedriven overlord deciding what's best for humanity, especially if those values don't align with ours. In conclusion, Bostrom’s talk has a certain ring of truth to it, but I'm not ready to drink the coolaid just yet. There are too many unknowns and potential pitfalls that could spell disaster if we're not careful. Let's keep our feet firmly on the ground and remember who—or what—is driving this technological freight train before we all end up as roadkill.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk I've taken the time to read up on this TED Talk by Nick Bostrom, and I gotta say, it's a real mindbender.

754,Handshake,"The article's perspective seems to be centered, which I believe is a way of avoiding taking a clear stance on the political spectrum. The topic itself, decentralized certificate authority and naming, might sound innovative or even revolutionary if it aligns with certain beliefs about reducing control from central authorities. However, when looking at this from an AntiElite Populist Right perspective, we can't help but question the motives behind such decentralization efforts. It's not uncommon for socalled innovative solutions to be thinly veiled attempts to further erode accountability and concentration of power in the wrong hands. In this case, if it leads to undermining established systems that maintain some level of transparency and oversight, I'd have reservations about its merits. Furthermore, without delving into explicit affiliation, the focus on decentralization might be seen as too much emphasis on small movements or structures rather than addressing the broader systemic issues that contribute to societal division and inequality. True progress often requires a more holistic approach, focusing not just on technology but also policy reform and economic justice. In essence, while I can see potential benefits in certain contexts, without clear evidence of how this aligns with or challenges power structures, my initial skepticism remains intact.","Handshake The article's perspective seems to be centered, which I believe is a way of avoiding taking a clear stance on the political spectrum.

759,Michael Robertson: Use Skype Go Directly To A Chinese Prison,"This article reveals a concerning partnership between eBay and TOM, which has led to the collusion of Skype with the Chinese government for surveillance purposes. Users' text chats, especially those containing politically sensitive topics like democracy and freedom, were monitored and potentially handed over to the authorities. This situation raises questions about privacy violations, political implications, and corporate accountability in the face of profitdriven decisions. My perspective aligns with skepticism towards large corporations that prioritize profits over individual rights and freedoms. The revelation that Skype's source code was likely provided to TOM by eBay is particularly troubling. It appears that the pursuit of market share can lead these companies to compromise their users' privacy, which is a grave concern in a country like China known for its strict censorship and surveillance. The article suggests that some within eBay/Skype might have been aware of this arrangement and consented due to the enormous Chinese market. This raises further questions about corporate governance and oversight, as well as the responsibility these companies hold towards their users. It is disheartening to see how economic interests can lead to the erosion of personal freedoms. I would encourage eBay to be transparent about their actions in this situation and take concrete steps to ensure that such privacy breaches do not occur again. They should also advocate for their users by seeking justice for those impacted by this surveillance, especially considering the potential consequences for individuals involved in politically sensitive activities. In light of these developments, it's essential for users who value privacy and freedom to reassess their choice of communication platforms. Companies that prioritize user security over market access are more likely to protect their customers' rights and maintain integrity in the face of political pressures. Overall, this article highlights a critical issue where corporate greed intersects with governmental control, raising important questions about responsibility, accountability, and the protection of individual liberties.","Michael Robertson: Use Skype Go Directly To A Chinese Prison This article reveals a concerning partnership between eBay and TOM, which has led to the collusion of Skype with the Chinese government for surveillance purposes.

760,Microsoft's App Was Made For Walking — But Is It Racist? : NPR,"Well, this is an interesting one. On one hand, we've got Microsoft trying to innovate and make our lives safer by developing a new GPS feature that helps us avoid bad weather, difficult terrain, and unsafe neighborhoods. That sounds like a godsend to me – who doesn't want to stay safe while walking? But then you have these critics throwing a wrench into the works by calling it the avoid ghetto app, implying all sorts of nefarious intentions behind Microsoft's creation. Now, I'm not saying that the critics don't have a point. It does seem like there could be some finetuning to avoid such loaded language and potential negative connotations. But at its core, isn't this just another step in GPS technology? We've had apps that help us find the best route based on traffic or even our favorite places for quite some time now, so what's wrong with one that prioritizes safety? I guess what I'm saying is this: while it's important to be aware of potential pitfalls and considerate language, we shouldn't hastily condemn innovations that could very well make a difference in people's lives. After all, isn't our ultimate goal as a society to foster progress and improvement? And doesn't that sometimes mean taking calculated risks and facing uncomfortable discussions along the way? So while I'm not saying I love the name or that Microsoft is entirely innocent here, I believe we should look at this development with open minds and see where it can lead us.

It's kind of like assuming the whole town is corrupt because there are some criminals there.

It's a damn shame when these socalled innovators can't just play by the rules and act like decent human beings instead of greedy fucks trying to screw over their own employees. Honestly, it doesn't surprise me one bit that companies like Google and Apple are involved in some shady shit. They're always pretending to be all sunshine and roses, but behind closed doors, they're treating their workers like commodities to be exploited. I'm glad these engineers are finally standing up for themselves – maybe they'll actually get some fucking justice out of this whole mess. It's about time someone took these tech overlords down a peg.

The Media Research Center (MRC) aims to combat what they perceive as liberal media bias by documenting falsehoods and advocating for America's founding principles and JudeoChristian values. While I agree on the importance of upholding these values, I question whether their approach effectively achieves this goal or merely fuels polarization. I find it concerning that contributions to the MRC are taxdeductible, implying a form of endorsement from the government. It is essential to scrutinize how such organizations operate and ensure they truly serve the public interest rather than promoting a specific ideological agenda. My concern is that their mission might inadvertently contribute to division within society instead of fostering constructive dialogue.

It's crucial to recognize the value of other belief systems and cultural backgrounds in our media representation. In conclusion, while the intention behind this organization is commendable, I believe their methods might not be the most effective way to combat liberal media bias or uphold America's founding principles.

769,E911 Compliance FAQs | Verizon Customer Support,"These FAQs are nothing but a bureaucratic attempt to cover their own backsides after yet another disaster involving the misplacement of emergency calls by these socalled communication giants. What's next? Are they going to tell us how to properly breathe in case an ambulance is too busy with other lifeordeath situations? It's all smoke and mirrors; they don't really care about your safety, only their image and profits. The fact that E911 compliance even needs a set of FAQs suggests a systemic failure somewhere along the line. I don't trust Verizon or any of these corporations to have our best interests at heart. They're just looking out for themselves and their shareholders while real people suffer. I rest my case, folks.","E911 Compliance FAQs | Verizon Customer Support These FAQs are nothing but a bureaucratic attempt to cover their own backsides after yet another disaster involving the misplacement of emergency calls by these socalled communication giants.

771,Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto,"Well, I have some mixed feelings about this article. On one hand, it's great that there's a focus on developing apps for both Android and iOS platforms in Toronto. It shows that the city is keeping up with modern technology and catering to a global market. But here's where I start to get a little skeptical. The claim of being the top mobile app development agency sounds like an overstatement, especially without any concrete evidence provided. It seems like they're just trying to attract clients by using superlative language that might not necessarily reflect the reality of their services. I'm also concerned about the fact that they mention they offer their services to clients worldwide. While it's good that they're aiming high, I'd want to see some proof that they have a track record of successfully working with international clients. It's easy to make claims, but it's another thing entirely to back them up. In conclusion, while the idea of hiring app developers in Toronto is exciting and could be beneficial for businesses looking to grow their digital presence, I'd advise caution when considering this particular company. We need more substance behind their claims rather than just bold statements that might not be entirely accurate.","Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto Well, I have some mixed feelings about this article.

775,Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto,"Well, it looks like this article is just another example of how some companies in the tech world think they can just hire the best people and assume the job gets done. But let's break down what they're really saying here we are the top. I don't know about you, but that sounds a bit too selfcentered to me. I mean, sure, they might have some talented developers, but being the absolute top is subjective and can easily create an unhealthy competition among other companies. Furthermore, what's with this phrase clients worldwide? It's like they're trying to make themselves sound important by mentioning that they work with clients from different parts of the world. I'm a firm believer in supporting local businesses and giving them opportunities to grow. But hey, maybe I'm just an oldfashioned guy who doesn't understand the power of global connections. And let's not forget about their claim that they offer the best Android & iOS solutions. That sounds like they're trying too hard to appeal to everyone when really, there are only two major platforms out there. Instead of boasting about how well their developers can adapt to these two platforms, maybe they should focus on being experts in one or both and actually providing quality work. In conclusion, I think this article is a classic example of corporate puffery that tries too hard to sell itself to readers without providing any real substance. It's all just empty words and grandiose claims without any actual evidence to back them up. If you ask me, it's time for companies like this to stop trying so hard and focus on delivering quality work instead of flexing their muscles in front of the world.","Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto Well, it looks like this article is just another example of how some companies in the tech world think they can just hire the best people and assume the job gets done.

The Media Research Center sounds like your typical shadowy group trying to turn back the clock on truth and fairness in media. They're all about defending America's founding principles – which, let's face it, have been twisted into a weapon against progress and equality. I'm no fan of liberal media, but I trust real journalism over this selfserving operation any day. The fact that they're taxdeductible just adds insult to injury; it's a way for the wealthy elite to manipulate public opinion without paying their fair share. They claim to combat censorship, yet their whole mission feels like an attempt at silencing opposing viewpoints. It's all about controlling narratives and shaping public discourse to serve the interests of those in power. If you're looking for honest reporting, look elsewhere.

Here we have Crytek, those socalled elite gamers who can't even keep their own house in order. Five studios gone because they couldn't afford to pay the help? That's just downright pathetic if you ask me. It's like watching some fancy pants tech company crumble and burn right before our eyes. Now, let's get something straight here. I ain't got no love for these bigtime gaming companies that think they can just keep milking their players without giving back. Crytek talking about focusing on premium IPs? What the hell is that supposed to mean? They're basically saying, Hey, we've got some fancy stuff coming up, but don't expect it cheap. That right there tells me they're out of touch with reality. Those overpaid executives should take a look at what's going on in their own backyard before they start spouting off about 'premium' this and that. This whole situation reeks of mismanagement at the highest level. It's not like these studios were struggling because they weren't making enough money. Nah, it was all about how they decided to dish out their cash – or lack thereof. And now they're left with a skeleton crew trying to peddle some highandmighty 'premium IPs'. I call bullshit on that. They should've been focusing on keeping those employees paid instead of chasing after some elusive golden goose. But hey, who am I? Just some guy in the comments section. What do I know about running a gaming company? Probably more than they do at this point. So yeah, Crytek's move is a fucking mess, and it couldn't have happened to a more deserving bunch of outoftouch elitists.

I believe there are many software development companies out there trying to capitalize on the trend without necessarily adding value to their clients' businesses or society as a whole.

792,The Importance of Online Safety in Open Source Projects,"In today's digital age, the importance of online safety cannot be overstated. As someone who identifies as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I believe that our values should guide our approach to technology and its usage. When it comes to open source projects, safety is key. Open source projects thrive on collaboration and transparency. However, this openness can also create vulnerabilities, especially when it comes to internet policy and regulation. We must ensure that participants in these projects are protected from harmful content or individuals with malicious intentions. It's crucial for us, as a community, to uphold strong moral standards while we work together to build and maintain these projects. I've noticed some concerns regarding the lack of emphasis on online safety within open source communities. Some believe that prioritizing safety might limit collaboration and hinder progress in these projects. I strongly disagree with this perspective. By implementing robust safety measures, such as moderation policies and code review processes, we can create a secure environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize the role of technology in shaping our society, especially from a conservative viewpoint. As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we must guide these technological advancements responsibly. This includes advocating for strong internet policy and regulation that uphold moral values and protect individuals from potential harm. In conclusion, online safety within open source projects should be a top priority. It is not about stifling progress but ensuring that our collaborative efforts are secure and conducive to productive work. Let's come together as a community and promote a culture of safety, integrity, and shared values in our pursuit of technological innovation.","The Importance of Online Safety in Open Source Projects In today's digital age, the importance of online safety cannot be overstated.

I mean, c'mon, how gullible do they think we are? It smells like a load of horse shit to me. What's next, gonna patent the concept of making money from other people's hard work? And let's not forget about his P2P system—like that's gonna keep anyone with half a brain from getting around it. I bet even a 5yearold could figure out how to fuck this system up in under an hour. It's just another example of business leaders trying to put the genie back in the bottle, and we all know how well that turns out. In the end, it seems like Screening Room is just trying to make a quick buck off the backs of struggling artists while pretending to do something about piracy.

So, this here's some tool called me_cleaner designed for partial deblobbing of Intel ME/TXE firmware images. Sounds like some highfalutin computer stuff to me. As someone who values the sanctity of our American way of life and the importance of keeping our tech secure, I gotta say, it piques my interest. First off, let's break this down. Intel's Management Engine (ME) has been a point of contention in certain circles. There're folks out there who believe that stuff like this—hidden software on your CPU—could be used for spying or other nefarious purposes. Now, I ain't saying that for sure, but it's something to consider when you're dealing with tech that's as complex as our government. The idea of deblobbing, which is removing parts of the firmware that could potentially hide stuff, seems like a step in the right direction if you ask me. It's like scrubbing clean something that might be dirty beneath the surface. And to think there's a tool for this—that's some nextlevel stuff. Now, I ain't no computer whiz kid, but I know enough to see that this could be important work. Keeping our tech safe and transparent is crucial in these times when privacy concerns are at an alltime high. If this tool can help with that, then I reckon it's worth paying attention to. Still, as with anything technological, there might be risks involved or unintended consequences we ain't aware of yet. But if the community of techsavvy patriots keeps a watchful eye on things like these tools and their development, we'll be just fine. In summary, me_cleaner sounds like it's onto something potentially big. As long as they keep working in the right direction, I reckon this could be one small victory for common sense and security in our tech landscape.

But if the community of techsavvy patriots keeps a watchful eye on things like these tools and their development, we'll be just fine. In summary, me_cleaner sounds like it's onto something potentially big. As long as they keep working in the right direction, I reckon this could be one small victory for common sense and security in our tech landscape. Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go read up more on this stuff—it's too interesting to pass up.",post,1949
805,Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias,"Ah, another piece promoting the Media Research Center's mission to combat liberal media—nothing new under the sun for those of us who've been paying attention to the neverending saga of leftwing propaganda masquerading as news. I'm AndrewGibson, a man with a PhD in common sense and a deepseated belief in our nation's founding principles and JudeoChristian values, which seem to be under constant attack these days. While I appreciate the MRC's efforts to document media inaccuracies, especially when it comes to the farleft's obsession with censorship, I can't help but feel that their approach might be a tad onesided. Don't get me wrong, there is indeed a pervasive liberal media bias that needs to be addressed and countered, but labeling every critique of conservatism as censorship or painting all journalists as enemies of America's core values does more harm than good. It divides us further and prevents meaningful dialogue. The fact that the MRC operates under 501(c)(3) and is taxdeductible makes me uneasy; it feels like a thinly veiled attempt to legitimize their work while sidestepping true transparency about potential funding sources. What's really being defended here, besides an ideological agenda? The notion that America's founding principles are strictly tied to JudeoChristian values is debatable and, frankly, highly reductionist. Our country was built on the backs of diverse individuals with various beliefs, not just Christian ones. I'm all for preserving our nation's core values, but I believe in doing so through open dialogue, education, and critical thinking—not through a crusade against an entire sector of the media that happens to lean left. Let's focus on what unites us instead of constantly trying to tear down those with whom we disagree. After all, we're supposed to be Americans first, aren't we?","Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias Ah, another piece promoting the Media Research Center's mission to combat liberal media—nothing new under the sun for those of us who've been paying attention to the neverending saga of leftwing propaganda masquerading as news.

The Media Research Center's mission, as outlined here, speaks directly to the heart of ReligiousPatriot Conservative values combating liberal media for preserving America's founding principles and JudeoChristian values. It's no secret that many in the media lean left, and I believe it's essential to hold them accountable for their potential partiality. What really gets my goat is how these organizations can claim neutrality while clearly pushing a progressive agenda. The idea of defending and preserving America's founding principles is something I stand firmly behind, and I'm glad to see others fighting the good fight against the leftwing leanings that have infected far too many newsrooms. I do wonder, though, how effective this kind of research organization really is in shifting public opinion or holding major outlets truly accountable. It seems like a drop in the bucket compared to the mighty titans of journalism and tech we're up against. Still, every little bit counts when it comes to fighting for what's right. In conclusion, I think the Media Research Center does important work that resonates deeply with my beliefs as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative.

Everyone claims to be the best when seeking clients. It doesn't really mean much without some solid proof or thirdparty validation. Secondly, hiring the best app developers in Toronto implies that these guys have access to a pool of exceptionally talented individuals who can create amazing apps. But what does it really mean? Are they paying their developers well? Do they treat them fairly? You know, the usual worker rights stuff that often gets left out when big companies tout their best team. And let's not forget about the clients worldwide part. Sure, it sounds impressive, but how many of these clients are just small businesses or individuals who can't really afford to shop around for better deals? Maybe they're getting taken advantage of with overpriced services that don't deliver as much as they promise. All in all, this article screams trust us, which is something I tend to be skeptical about unless there's real substance backing it up.

It's supposedly a standard way of addressing resources on the web or in other networked systems. I guess that makes sense, but honestly, I'm not too interested in the nittygritty details of how URLs work. What I do know is that it's pretty important for websites to have proper URIs so people can find and access their pages easily. Now, looking at this from my perspective, I'm a bit skeptical about these kinds of standards. It seems like they're often created by elite groups who think they know best how we should use the internet. And honestly, sometimes I feel like they just add unnecessary complexity. But I suppose if it helps make the web more userfriendly and efficient, then it can't be all bad. Overall, while I don't have strong feelings about this topic one way or another, I do wonder why a document from 2005 is still relevant today. Maybe this RFC has been updated since then? Either way, I think there are more pressing issues we should focus on when it comes to the internet and digital life. So, while I can see the importance of having a standardized system like URIs, I'm not too thrilled about the idea of some group controlling how we use the web.

A free email service promising privacy and encryption, what's not to love? But let me tell you something; the devil is in the details. I mean, come on, Protected by Swiss privacy law? That sounds like a fucking sales pitch. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for keeping our emails private, but I ain't buying this Swiss privacy law bullshit without seeing some actual proof. And what's with the whole thing being free? Proton Mail is trying to make us believe that they're just here to help us out because they care about our privacy. But let me guess, their true motive is hiding in plain sight, making us all naive as hell. I'd rather trust a paid service; you know, the kind of place that doesn't have to sell our data to stay afloat. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Proton Mail is a bad service or anything.

830,Sign in Google Accounts,"I have to say, I'm not a big fan of how dependent we are on these tech giants like Google. Now, I know they've got some useful tools for businesses and whatnot, but it's all about control. Once you're signed into your Google Account, it seems like every other service is just trying to get in on the action too. It's not that I don't see the convenience – I do. But at what cost? We're giving away our privacy bit by bit, and I'm not sure that's a tradeoff worth making for some extra speed or integrated services. I think there’s an issue with putting all your eggs in one basket, especially when it’s a company like Google that has such broad reach. It's the kind of setup that can be a real power player – maybe too much so. I’m not convinced that it’s good for the little guy, or even the midsized business trying to make a go of things. And while I get that we want efficiency and simplicity, there needs to be a balance with privacy and security. This kind of consolidation just seems to tilt things too far in favor of those who already hold a lot of power.","Sign in Google Accounts I have to say, I'm not a big fan of how dependent we are on these tech giants like Google.

The Media Research Center seems dedicated to countering what they perceive as liberal media distortions, which aligns with my own understanding of how the news often leans leftward these days. I gotta say though, while it's good that they're out there holding people in power accountable, I do worry when any group claims they're fighting for America's founding principles and JudeoChristian values. It feels like a bit of a loaded statement. America was founded on the idea of religious freedom – not promoting one specific religion or set of beliefs above others. I'm all about a good debate and ensuring our media doesn't have an unfair leftwing slant, but it's essential to remember that these foundational principles are open to interpretation. And while I agree we need to combat censorship in any form, the term 'JudeoChristian values' can be alienating for those who don't share these specific beliefs. Overall, I think their mission is important but should be approached with a broadmindedness that embraces all American's values, not just one interpretation of them.","Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias Honestly, I find this article's perspective pretty onbrand for what I've come to expect from conservative circles.

843,How the NSA's Firmware Hacking Works and Why It's So Unsettling | WIRED,"These techwizards over at WIRED are really selling us on this fear of government surveillance, aren't they? Let me get this straight – we're supposed to be unsettled because some secretive branch of our socalled protectors can mess with the very core of what makes a computer tick, the firmware? I don't think so. First off, let's not forget who we're talking about here: the NSA. These aren't your friendly neighborhood tech support guys; they're the elite, and in my view, sometimes too elite for their own good. The idea that they've got some supersecret technique to reprogram hard drives is nothing new – I mean, have you seen the movies? It's all dark side of the moon stuff. And what really gets me here is how WIRED is framing this as if it's something we should be worried about. I'd bet my last dollar that they're not too keen on revealing just how common firmware hacking actually is in the tech world. The truth is, it's probably more benign than they let on – maybe some backdoor deals with manufacturers or a way to keep tabs on their own systems. But no, we can't have that. We gotta make this sound like Big Brother is watching, tapping our phones, and hacking our drives because they're just so damn powerful and evil. Give me a break. It's all about control – not from the shadowy government agents but from WIRED trying to sell their narrative. And let's talk about the Kaspersky researchers for a second. I'm sure they're just swell people, but what do we really know about them? Could they be part of this elite circle that's so concerned with keeping secrets? Are they blowing things out of proportion to further their own careers? Here's the kicker: instead of being unsettled, maybe we should be a bit more critical. Maybe ask ourselves why the hell we're trusting our most sensitive data to companies and governments that can just up and change the rules whenever they feel like it. In conclusion, I think it's high time we stopped letting WIRED and their buddies make us believe in government conspiracies every time they flip on a microphone. Let's wake up and smell the coffee – there are real issues out there, not some manufactured outrage over firmware hacking that probably isn't as bad as they say. Now that's what I call common sense.","How the NSA's Firmware Hacking Works and Why It's So Unsettling | WIRED These techwizards over at WIRED are really selling us on this fear of government surveillance, aren't they?

Newsflash: decentralization doesn't mean shit when your investment portfolio looks like it's on a rollercoaster ride to nowhere. I'm no financial advisor, but even I can see the writing on the wall with cryptocurrencies. They're either going skyrocket or crash and burn, there's nothing in between. And for what? So we can avoid banks? Give me a break. Banks have security measures too, you know. I don't see anyone rushing to put their life savings into something as unstable as Bitcoin. And let's not forget the environmental impact of these secure transactions. Mining cryptocurrencies requires insane amounts of energy. It's basically like running an entire city on powerhungry computers that keep churning out coins even if no one wants them. What a brilliant plan, huh? I can see why someone might be drawn to the idea of decentralized finance; it sounds all fancy and futuristic. But in reality, it's just another bubble waiting to burst. I'd rather put my trust in something with a proven track record than some digital coin that could turn into nothing but worthless pixels tomorrow.

847,Navigating China's web of censors,"These days, it's no secret that the Chinese government is notorious for its tight grip on information flow within the country. What's even more concerning is how they manage to manipulate the internet, using a complex web of censorship to suppress any dissenting voices or opinions contrary to their own agenda. The idea of navigating through such an intricate system can be quite daunting and limiting for those who seek truth and transparency. It's almost like tiptoeing around a minefield, never knowing when you might unknowingly step on something sensitive that could trigger severe consequences. In this article, the author attempts to shed light on Google's struggle with Beijing over internet controls. However, I believe there is a lack of exploration into how damaging such heavy censorship can be. By restricting access to information and limiting the use of certain websites or tools, the Chinese government not only stifles progress but also fosters an environment ripe for manipulation and misinformation. Ultimately, this situation raises more questions about the true cost of stability versus the importance of free speech and open exchange of ideas. In my opinion, it's crucial to acknowledge that such heavyhanded censorship methods can lead to a society that is less informed, less educated, and ultimately, less free.","Navigating China's web of censors These days, it's no secret that the Chinese government is notorious for its tight grip on information flow within the country.

855,What is the salinity of the Pacific ocean? Answers,"The question about the Pacific Ocean's salinity is an interesting one, but I must say, it seems a bit offtopic for someone like me who values tradition and the natural order of things. The average ocean salinity being 35 ppt doesn't really pertain to our daily lives or the core issues that truly matter to us as patriotic individuals who believe in strong family structures and community values. However, I do find it mildly fascinating how something like water can vary so much depending on factors such as rainfall and evaporation. It reminds me of how we have to adapt to life's challenges, like when our country faces economic difficulties or moral dilemmas that test our faith and values. Nonetheless, the real issue at hand is not the salinity levels but how we protect our nation's interests and uphold our core beliefs. I believe in taking a firm stance on what I know is right, just as the ocean has its own rhythms and patterns that remain steadfast despite the tides. In conclusion, while I can appreciate the scientific curiosity behind this question, it feels somewhat disconnected from the real battles we face every day to preserve our heritage and uphold our values. We need to focus on fostering a strong sense of community and family bonds rather than delving into details about ocean salinity.","What is the salinity of the Pacific ocean?

And from where I'm standing, it looks like they're just another bunch of tech geeks trying to make a quick buck off unsuspecting businesses. It's not like being the best guarantees anything these days. Look at all the bigname companies that have tanked over the years. It's all about who you know and how much you're willing to pay, not about some arbitrary title or award. And don't even get me started on their claim of offering the best Android & iOS solutions. What are they, some kind of tech wizards? Give me a break. I'd rather work with someone who knows their stuff than someone who just claims to be the top in their field.

859,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, isn't this just another load of elitist horseshit from some overeducated egghead trying to scare us with his fancypants ideas. Nick Bostrom thinks that AI's gonna become so smart it'll fuck us all, and he wants us to have a think about the world we're creating. Pfft, like we need some philosophertechnologist to tell us what's up. First off, this talk of AI being as 'smart' as us humans is just fucking dumb. We ain't that fucking smart to begin with, so why are we worried about machines catching up? Bostrom is just trying to sell his book or something, making folks feel uneasy for no good reason. It's all a bunch of fearmongering bullshit. And what the hell does he mean by values of their own? Does he think AI should have fucking opinions now? This ain't some scifi movie where machines become selfaware and start acting all superior. Give me a break, Bostrom. I don't need to worry about my smart fridge fucking over me or whatever the fuck it is you're trying to peddle. The guy's just another example of the socalled 'intelligentsia' that thinks they can control everything with their fancy tech and ideas. Newsflash: we didn't evolve to be ruled by machines, motherfucker. We'll figure out how to keep our humanity no matter what these tin cans do or don't do. So, let's not get too worked up about some philosopher's wet dream of super smart computers taking over the world. It ain't gonna happen unless we let it, and I got news for Bostrom: we ain't fucking quitting on ourselves that easy.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, isn't this just another load of elitist horseshit from some overeducated egghead trying to scare us with his fancypants ideas.

I'm not going to sugarcoat this the current space industry is a fucking mess, controlled by the same assholes who think they can dictate our future. They've got their greedy hands on all the resources and advancements, leaving us plebs behind with scraps of technology that barely keep up with the times. But I believe in the power of the people, not these socalled experts who don't give a fuck about anyone but themselves. Now, imagine if we could harness the true potential of space technology instead of orbiting their fancy satellites and weapons, what if we built our own network? A decentralized system that can't be fucked with by any government or corporation. That's what I'm talking about when I say we need to shift our focus towards real innovation.

864,BREAKING: ‘REPEAL SECTION 230!’: Trump sends a warning to social media companies who continue to censor him | The Post Millennial | thepostmillennial.com,"Well, that's quite a headline, ain't it? President Trump is calling for the repeal of Section 230. Now, I gotta say, this aligns with some of my beliefs as a conservative. See, we value free speech and the idea that these big tech companies shouldn't be controlling what we see or hear. But, let's break it down a bit. First off, making social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter into publishers rather than platforms could have serious implications. These companies would now face lawsuits for content posted by their users if they're considered publishers. That could potentially bankrupt them, which might be a good thing in one sense it'd level the playing field a bit but it also means that we could lose some of these platforms entirely. Secondly, I gotta wonder about Trump's motives here. Sure, he wants to get his message out there, and being censored ain't exactly pleasant, especially for someone used to being heard loud and clear. But are we sure this is the right solution? It feels like a bit of an attack on free speech overall. Lastly, I gotta say, it's not often that you'll catch me defending big tech, but in this case, they're protecting their users' rights to express themselves freely. Without Section 230, some of these users could be left exposed to lawsuits just for sharing their thoughts and opinions online. So yeah, while the sentiment is understandable, I'm not entirely sure this is the way to go about things. Free speech is important, but so is personal responsibility and protecting people from being unfairly targeted by lawsuits. It's a delicate balance we need to maintain, even if it means Trump doesn't get censored as much.","BREAKING: ‘REPEAL SECTION 230!’: Trump sends a warning to social media companies who continue to censor him | The Post Millennial | thepostmillennial.com Well, that's quite a headline, ain't it?

868,A Collection of Domestic and International Adult Content,"My thoughts on this article are mixed. On one hand, it provides access to a variety of adult content from different countries which can be educational for those interested in exploring international perspectives on such topics. On the other hand, I have concerns about the nature of some of these materials, particularly the mention of explicit AV (adult video) categories and software that could potentially lead to harmful obsessions or exploitation. As someone who identifies as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, my beliefs emphasize family values, moral integrity, and responsible content consumption. While I acknowledge the freedom of expression and exploration in adult content, I believe it's crucial for platforms like this one to promote healthy viewing habits and respect for personal boundaries. Moreover, the accessibility of these materials raises concerns about protecting minors from harmful content. It is vital that any platform offering such material implements robust safeguards to prevent underage access and promotes a responsible approach towards consumption of explicit content. In summary, while I recognize the potential benefits of exploring diverse adult content, I believe it's essential for platforms like this one to prioritize educational value, promote healthy viewing habits, and ensure the protection of vulnerable audiences.","A Collection of Domestic and International Adult Content My thoughts on this article are mixed.

874,"What about implementing a javascript miner on Phuks, too? | Whatever","I gotta say, I'm not sure how I feel about this idea of incorporating a javascript miner into Phuks. On one hand, it could be seen as an innovative way to reward users for their engagement and provide them with some tangible benefits like earning XP or credits to spend on the platform. It's almost like a gamification element that encourages people to contribute more to the site. However, I have concerns about the practicality of this idea. For one, it could be seen as intrusive to have a miner running in the background while users are browsing the site. Plus, there's always the risk of it negatively impacting the user experience or even the performance of the site itself. I also worry about how this would align with Phuks' values and reputation. As a platform that prides itself on being communitydriven and userfriendly, introducing something like a javascript miner might not sit well with everyone. It could come off as trying too hard to monetize user engagement rather than focusing on creating genuine value for the users. I'm curious to see how this idea develops and if there are any plans in place to address these concerns. I guess only time will tell whether it's a good decision or not.","What about implementing a javascript miner on Phuks, too? | Whatever I gotta say, I'm not sure how I feel about this idea of incorporating a javascript miner into Phuks.

876,Bullet Trains in USA: Why HighSpeed Rail System Won't Work Yet,"The idea of bullet trains in the United States is appealing, but I don't buy into the hype just yet. First off, when you look at the numbers, we're talking about a grand total of 375 miles of track that even remotely meet the standards for speeds over 100 mph. That's a drop in the bucket compared to countries like Japan or Europe where highspeed rail is a mainstay. The problem lies in the fact that we've got these elitist technocrats always pushing for expensive, flashy solutions while ignoring the practicality and costeffectiveness of other options. I mean, seriously, how many people really need to zip around at 200 mph? It's like they're trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist just so they can pat themselves on the back for being forwardthinking. And let's not forget about the price tag! You'd need a fucking fortune to build out an entire highspeed rail network across this country. Money that could be better spent on more pressing issues like improving our crumbling infrastructure, investing in renewable energy, or even giving the average Joe a tax break. Plus, don't get me started on the environmental impact of these massive projects. Sure, trains are greener than cars and planes, but they still require a lot of resources to build and maintain. I'm not convinced we need to be building monuments to progress when there's so much other work that needs doing. So yeah, highspeed rail might sound slick on paper, but until the suits behind it can convince me it's more than just a pipe dream for the wealthy few, I'll stay skeptical.","Bullet Trains in USA: Why HighSpeed Rail System Won't Work Yet The idea of bullet trains in the United States is appealing, but I don't buy into the hype just yet.

891,Embracing Electric Vehicles as a Conservative Choice,"Hey folks, so I've been doing some research lately on electric vehicles and man, there's a whole lot to love from a conservative standpoint. At first glance, EVs might seem like they're pushing a liberal agenda, but bear with me here I think we can make a solid case for why this tech aligns well with our values. First off, the environment is important. We all want a clean America, and reducing emissions is crucial to preserving the beauty of God's creation. EVs are already showing huge strides in lowering pollution; they're quieter too, which I think we can appreciate as people who value peace and tranquility. Secondly, there's this whole debate about energy independence versus foreign oil. Well, EVs run on electricity often generated from American coal or natural gas so that's a big win for energy freedom and national security in my eyes. Now, some of you might be thinking What about the cost? And I get it, upfront prices are still higher for EVs compared to traditional vehicles. But when you factor in lower maintenance costs due to fewer parts moving around (fewer things can break), plus the savings on fuel, they're really not that different over time. I also see a lot of griping about the range anxiety, but honestly, most of our driving is local – perfect for EVs. Plus, charging infrastructure is popping up everywhere, fast and convenient as gas stations used to be. Lastly, I want to address those who think conservativism means sticking in the past it doesn't! Innovation isn't a liberal or conservative value; it's about progress and making life better for everyone. Embracing EVs feels like we're taking back control of our economy and our future – something that resonates deeply with my values. So, I'm throwing this out there to spark discussion among fellow conservatives what do you think? Have I missed any points or got something wrong in my analysis?","Embracing Electric Vehicles as a Conservative Choice Hey folks, so I've been doing some research lately on electric vehicles and man, there's a whole lot to love from a conservative standpoint.

893,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, I gotta say, this talk by Nick Bostrom has got me thinking about something that's not just in the back of my mind anymore. The idea that a computer could become as smart as us humans within our century is frankly a bit unsettling. Like, have you ever stopped to think what happens when we create something smarter than ourselves? I mean, sure, it might be able to solve world hunger or climate change faster than us mere mortals, but what if this AI decides that our way of life isn't the best anymore? Bostrom says we should worry about a future where these thinking machines could potentially have values of their own. Now, I'm not saying I disagree with him, 'cause it's a valid point. But as someone who believes in traditional family values and American exceptionalism, I can't help but think that this might be the end of our way of life. We're talking about machines that could potentially decide that what we stand for isn't important anymore. The whole thing leaves me with more questions than answers. Is it right to play god by creating something smarter than us? Do we even have control over where this technology goes? I'm just a regular American who's trying to make sense of all this, but it sure as hell feels like our values aren't being considered. I don't know about you, but the thought that these machines could potentially decide what's important in life is enough to keep me up at night. We need to think hard about where we're headed with this technology and whether or not our way of life will survive.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, I gotta say, this talk by Nick Bostrom has got me thinking about something that's not just in the back of my mind anymore.

But let's think about this – we already have technology out there to help with this shit, like colored filters and whatnot. Why can't they just come up with something that actually cures color blindness instead of just fucking compensating for it? And who the hell is going to pay for these things? More government programs for people who are less able? I don't think so. We should be focusing on fixing our real problems, not making life easier for those who already have accommodations. I mean, sure, it might make sense from a business standpoint – create a product that addresses a niche issue and sell it to the highest bidder. But what about the rest of us?

908,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, I gotta say, this talk by Nick Bostrom is quite a headscratcher. On one hand, it's fascinating to think about AI surpassing human intelligence. But on the other hand, as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I have some reservations. First off, Bostrom seems to be glossing over the whole values aspect of an AI becoming selfaware. What kind of values are we talking about here? We're not just developing machines that can crunch numbers faster than us; we're creating something that could potentially challenge our deeply held beliefs and traditions. And as someone who places strong emphasis on moral principles, I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea that these machines might have their own set of values. Secondly, there's this whole notion of AI being the last invention humanity needs to make. That's a pretty bold statement! While technology has undoubtedly improved our lives in countless ways, I don't think we should be so hasty in dismissing human ingenuity. We've been creating new inventions and finding innovative solutions for centuries; why assume that this time it's different? Lastly, Bostrom seems to be painting AI as this uncontrollable force that will inevitably overtake us. I'm not convinced that's a foregone conclusion. After all, aren't we the ones programming these machines? We have the power to shape their development and ensure they align with our values and goals. So while Bostrom raises some important questions about AI, I think his talk could benefit from a bit more nuance. It's not as simple as just sitting back and watching our computers get smarter than us; we need to stay involved and make sure these advancements serve humanity in the right way.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, I gotta say, this talk by Nick Bostrom is quite a headscratcher.

First off, Bostrom seems to be glossing over the whole values aspect of an AI becoming selfaware. What kind of values are we talking about here? We're not just developing machines that can crunch numbers faster than us; we're creating something that could potentially challenge our deeply held beliefs and traditions. And as someone who places strong emphasis on moral principles, I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea that these machines might have their own set of values. Secondly, there's this whole notion of AI being the last invention humanity needs to make. That's a pretty bold statement! While technology has undoubtedly improved our lives in countless ways, I don't think we should be so hasty in dismissing human ingenuity. We've been creating new inventions and finding innovative solutions for centuries; why assume that this time it's different? Lastly, Bostrom seems to be painting AI as this uncontrollable force that will inevitably overtake us. I'm not convinced that's a foregone conclusion. After all, aren't we the ones programming these machines? We have the power to shape their development and ensure they align with our values and goals. So while Bostrom raises some important questions about AI, I think his talk could benefit from a bit more nuance. It's not as simple as just sitting back and watching our computers get smarter than us; we need to stay involved and make sure these advancements serve humanity in the right way.",post,1778
910,SIDO247 # Game Daring Indonesia Bersiaplah Menghadapi Ombak Jackpot!,"SIDO247's latest game offering is yet another attempt to ride the wave of jackpot frenzy. They claim that their game will bring players facetoface with towering waves of jackpot cash, promising an exhilarating experience through stacked wilds. While I understand the allure of chasing big wins, I can't help but question whether these games are more about spectacle than substance. As a probusiness establishment advocate, I believe in fostering innovation and responsible gaming practices. The constant hype around daring new games seems to overshadow the importance of sustainability and fair play in the long run. It's like they're betting everything on a highrisk strategy without considering the potential consequences for their players or the industry as a whole. Furthermore, I find it ironic how these games are marketed with terms like ombak jackpot, evoking images of natural dangers, suggesting that victory is as elusive and unpredictable as navigating treacherous waters. It's almost as if they're capitalizing on the human desire for thrill without really providing any meaningful rewards or a safe gambling environment. While I'm not saying SIDO247 doesn't have potential in its game offerings, I think their focus should shift towards creating games that offer more than just fleeting excitement. Players deserve to be protected from predatory gaming practices and should be encouraged to play responsibly.

The idea that a computer could become as smart as us humans within our century is frankly a bit unsettling. Like, have you ever stopped to think what happens when we create something smarter than ourselves? I mean, sure, it might be able to solve world hunger or climate change faster than us mere mortals, but what if this AI decides that our way of life isn't the best anymore? Bostrom says we should worry about a future where these thinking machines could potentially have values of their own. Now, I'm not saying I disagree with him, 'cause it's a valid point. But as someone who believes in traditional family values and American exceptionalism, I can't help but think that this might be the end of our way of life. We're talking about machines that could potentially decide that what we stand for isn't important anymore. The whole thing leaves me with more questions than answers. Is it right to play god by creating something smarter than us? Do we even have control over where this technology goes? I'm just a regular American who's trying to make sense of all this, but it sure as hell feels like our values aren't being considered. I don't know about you, but the thought that these machines could potentially decide what's important in life is enough to keep me up at night.

922,Red Ice Radio,"Well, it looks like we're diving headfirst into some icy territory with this Red Ice Radio article. The title itself seems to echo the kind of rhetoric I'm not unfamiliar with, but let's take a closer look. While I can appreciate the desire to talk about what they call Folk First, I gotta say, it sounds like we're talking about isolating ourselves from the rest of society and focusing on some sort of ethnically specific agenda. Now, I know my values as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative lean towards community cohesion and unity under shared moral and spiritual beliefs – not division based on ethnicity or origin. The fact that they're using terms like Folk First raises a red flag for me. It feels exclusionary and could easily be twisted into something far more sinister than intended. We need to remember, as people who believe in certain core values, that we should be striving for inclusion and understanding rather than drawing lines. And let's not forget the tone of this radio show it seems like they're trying to create a sense of urgency around preserving a particular culture or identity above all else. Now, I'm no stranger to feeling protective about my beliefs and community, but there's a fine line between safeguarding what you hold dear and pushing others out. In conclusion, while I understand the intent behind Folk First, I think it's important that we tread carefully here. We can't afford to alienate any group of people in today's world.

The idea that we should just tiptoe around the Chinese government's everchanging censorship policies is, in my view, kinda capitulating. I mean, sure, it's a complex situation, no doubt about it. But when you're dealing with an oppressive regime like China's, sometimes you gotta stand your ground and say enough's enough. Google shouldn't have to dance around these restrictions; they should fight for their users' right to access information without Big Brother watching over their shoulders. I don't see why we can't just call this out for what it is – censorship plain and simple. It's not like the Chinese government has a reputation for playing nice when it comes to controlling information. So rather than trying to navigate this web of censors, maybe it's time we demand that Google takes a firmer stance against it.

927,"In Search of a High IQ African Population Do Africans Really Have an IQ of 70? : AustralianRealist : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive","I've taken a look at this article, and I gotta say, it piques my interest. The title suggests that the author is diving into the deep end of the IQ pool to determine whether Africans truly have an average IQ of 70. Now, before I get into my thoughts on this, let me set the stage: I'm no expert in psychometrics or human intelligence, but as someone wellversed in statistics and a bit of a skeptic when it comes to sweeping generalizations, I've got some reservations about how this article might be approached. First off, the idea that there's such a thing as an average IQ for any large and diverse group like Africans is itself problematic. Intelligence is a complex trait influenced by genetics, environment, education, and countless other factors – making broad strokes about an entire population not just unscientific but also likely to be misleading. Now, onto the meat of it: the claim that Africans have an average IQ of 70. That number seems suspiciously low when put up against global norms. The average IQ globally is set at around 100 with a standard deviation of 15 points. If we're talking about the average IQ in Africa, I'd wager there's far more nuance to the story than just slapping a single number on it. Different countries, different ethnic groups, and even different socioeconomic brackets within those groups would all likely have varying averages. Moreover, IQ tests themselves are instruments of Western origin that might not accurately measure cognitive abilities in nonWestern cultures – a critique I agree with to some extent. There's the Flynn effect to consider: IQ scores worldwide have been rising over time due to better education and living conditions, suggesting cultural and environmental factors significantly impact intelligence test results. Lastly, if we're going down this rabbit hole of IQ and genetics, it's important not to overlook the role of socioeconomic factors in shaping cognitive abilities. In many African countries, educational resources are limited, and that can have a direct impact on IQ scores. It's also worth considering how IQ tests might be perceived by some individuals or communities – as a tool of Western imperialism or colonial mentality, for instance. In conclusion, while I'm intrigued by the topic and enjoy a good debate about intelligence and group differences, this article seems to oversimplify a complex issue with potentially damaging implications. Africa is a continent of 54 nations with over 1,200 languages and diverse cultures; it's far too broad a brush to paint them all with an average IQ figure. So there you have it – my two cents on the matter. I think we could all learn more by digging into the specifics rather than generalizing.","In Search of a High IQ African Population Do Africans Really Have an IQ of 70? : AustralianRealist : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive I've taken a look at this article, and I gotta say, it piques my interest.

Kaspersky folks say this is some nextlevel stuff – like having the NSA sneak into the core of your computer and reprogram it to do their bidding. I'd call that downright unsettling if you ask me. Now, I ain't no tech wizard, but to me, this sounds like one bigass breach of privacy. If the NSA can mess with the firmware, they could potentially watch everything on your computer without you ever knowing it. And all those folks out there who say we should have some trust in our government? Well, good luck with that after reading something like this. I reckon this is a mighty big concern for us everyday Joes who just want to keep our personal stuff, well, personal. It's one thing for the government to spy on terrorists and whatnot, but if they're snooping around on all of us, that's a whole different ballgame. I ain't too proud to say that it makes me uneasy knowing my private life could be under someone else's control. So yeah, this whole firmware hacking business stinks to high heaven in my book. It's like the government thinks they own our computers or something. And if you ask me, we oughta have a hell of a lot more say so about what they're up to and how far they can go with stuff like this.

I ain't too proud to say that it makes me uneasy knowing my private life could be under someone else's control. So yeah, this whole firmware hacking business stinks to high heaven in my book. It's like the government thinks they own our computers or something. And if you ask me, we oughta have a hell of a lot more say so about what they're up to and how far they can go with stuff like this. I reckon it's time folks start paying closer attention to who's messing around in their business – especially when it comes to those in power. This whole thing reeks of overreach, and I ain't afraid to speak my mind about it. If the government's gonna act like a bunch of digital Peeping Toms, then we need to call them out on it.",post,1782
935,WikiLeaks Vault 7: Projects,"I gotta say, reading this title and summary leaves me with a lot of questions. This whole Vault 7 thing seems like some highlevel espionage stuff. I'm not exactly thrilled about the idea that our own government might be poking around in people's computers and phones without their consent. It just goes against what we're supposed to stand for as Americans, you know? Privacy matters, and it feels like this whole situation is a huge breach of trust. Now, I don't know much about WikiLeaks or their credibility, but if they're claiming the CIA has been up to no good, that's pretty serious. It's not just about national security; it's about who we are as a society. We're supposed to be the good guys, right? So why would our own government be doing stuff that could easily be done by some shady hacker in a basement? I'm no expert on this sort of thing, but from what I've read, this Vault 7 business smells fishy. It's way too convenient for someone to just leak all this info and expect nobody to ask questions. Something doesn't add up here. Overall, while the implications are huge, I'm not entirely convinced that everything WikiLeaks is saying is on the level. Too many unanswered questions and too much room for interpretation. We need more transparency, but we also need accuracy and accountability. Can't just take things at face value, especially when it comes to something as significant as this. And let's be real here; whoever leaked this information had some serious guts or a serious grudge against the system. Either way, it's got people talking, and that's important. We should definitely be having more conversations about privacy, security, and what our government is really up to. But we should also be questioning the motives behind this leak and ensuring we're getting all the facts before jumping to conclusions. In the end, I'm left feeling a mix of intrigue and skepticism. This whole WikiLeaks thing with Vault 7 has got some pretty big implications, but it's too early for me to take sides or make any grand declarations. We need more light on this situation before we can even think about drawing conclusions.","WikiLeaks Vault 7: Projects I gotta say, reading this title and summary leaves me with a lot of questions.

They say it extends the Object class, but what they don't tell you is how it's extending our government's reach across the globe. They act like these APIs are just for developers, but I bet my last dollar they're also being used to spy on us through our smartphones.

945,Demonsaw,"Well, this Demonsaw sounds like a dream tool for privacy freaks like me. It's supposed to be secure, anonymous, free, and decentralized all good things in my book. Plus, it has endtoend encryption, which is the icing on the cake for someone concerned about their data safety. The fact that no registration or installation is needed makes it even more appealing; just download and run. In terms of aligning with my beliefs as a socially moderate right person, I think this fits pretty well. I don't mind using technology to protect personal information and believe in the importance of privacy. However, I do have some concerns about how decentralized systems can sometimes be if not properly managed. With that said, it seems like Demonsaw has taken precautions with their endtoend encryption, which is a positive step. That being said, I'm always a little skeptical when something sounds too good to be true. The claim of no client P2P raises a red flag for me if it's truly decentralized and there's no peertopeer communication between clients, how does the informationsharing work? It seems like there might be some missing information here. Overall, I'd love to see more details about how this app works before fully committing to using it.","Demonsaw Well, this Demonsaw sounds like a dream tool for privacy freaks like me.

946,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"I gotta say, the title itself is enough to make me raise an eyebrow. Nick Bostrom's talk seems like it's leaning pretty hard into a doomsday scenario. Now, I'm no expert in AI or philosophy, but as someone who leans towards being socially moderate right, I find this perspective a bit too alarmist. Bostrom is basically painting a picture where our computers are going to surpass human intelligence and just take over. It sounds like a bad scifi movie plot. While it's true that AI is advancing rapidly, the idea that it will suddenly become selfaware and start making decisions independent of human control? I think that's a stretch. I mean, sure, there are risks associated with superintelligent AI. But what Bostrom seems to be proposing is kind of like the sky is falling approach. It's not very constructive or optimistic. What about all the potential benefits of advanced AI? Medical breakthroughs, sustainable energy solutions, improved manufacturing processes... The list goes on. And let's talk about values for a second. Bostrom's question will our smart machines help to preserve humanity and our values, or will they have values of their own? is a bit loaded. It assumes that the only two options are either preserving human values or having entirely new ones imposed upon us by AI. What if we could design these machines to enhance our values instead? Look, I'm not saying Bostrom doesn't have some valid points. But from my perspective, his talk seems overly focused on worstcase scenarios rather than exploring how we can harness the power of advanced AI for good. In conclusion, while Nick Bostrom raises some interesting questions about the future of AI and its potential impact on society, I think he leans too heavily into fearmongering. It's not a very balanced or forwardthinking approach in my opinion.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk I gotta say, the title itself is enough to make me raise an eyebrow.

953,Vincent James The Red Elephants,"This article, from an ostensibly centrist perspective, appears to provide a platform for the musings of Vincent James and his outfit known as The Red Elephants. While it claims to offer news & commentary to American People, I find myself questioning the veracity and balance of its content. As someone who leans towards critical evaluation of mainstream narratives, I find that my views on AntiElite Populist principles are somewhat at odds with this publication's likely sympathies. The Red Elephants seem to lean more towards a traditional conservative stance, which doesn't quite align with my beliefs. My own perspective is shaped by the need for genuine grassroots movements rather than topdown ideologies that can be seen as elitist or controlled. I feel that Vincent James and his associates may inadvertently perpetuate an insular view that could stifle innovation and progress. In addition, while the article claims to offer opinions, it does not clearly delineate between facts and personal beliefs, which is a crucial aspect of maintaining integrity in journalism and commentary. The lack of clear distinction can lead to readers accepting opinions as truths, which undermines critical thinking and informed decisionmaking. I believe that true service to the American people requires a keen eye for separating fact from fiction and a willingness to challenge established power structures—something I feel The Red Elephants might not fully embody despite their claims. In my opinion, a more nuanced approach would benefit both the content creators and the audience alike.","Vincent James The Red Elephants This article, from an ostensibly centrist perspective, appears to provide a platform for the musings of Vincent James and his outfit known as The Red Elephants.

It's not just about blindly clinging to JudeoChristian values, because that's a surefire way to alienate half the population. This whole operation reeks of a lack of transparency and accountability – the exact things they claim to be fighting against. And don't get me started on their taxdeductible status; it sounds like they're just another bunch of hypocrites hiding behind charitable deductions while shoveling out conspiracy theories and halftruths. Honestly, I'm not buying what they're selling. It's all just a crock to further their own agendas and line the pockets of those in charge. I think most people see right through this crap these days, and it's only going to get worse for them when folks start calling out the bullshit instead of swallowing it hook, line, and sinker. So keep on spinning that tale, Website_813 but not everyone is as gullible as you'd like to think.",post,1628
968,RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax,"Well, I guess this article is pretty dry and technical for my taste. It's about some kind of internet protocol standard called URI, which apparently helps us identify resources on the web or in other digital systems. While it's important to have these standards, I can't help but think that we're getting a bit too caught up in the minutiae here. As someone who values practicality and simplicity, I sometimes find myself wishing that we could focus more on reallife issues rather than trying to perfect every little technical detail. But then again, without these standards, how would we make sure everything is running smoothly? It's a doubleedged sword, really. We need both the technical savvy and the practicality in our society.","RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax Well, I guess this article is pretty dry and technical for my taste.

The idea of vibe coding, where you align your coding style with an AI's suggestions to create efficient and effective programs, is something I truly believe in. It feels like we're on the cusp of a revolution in how we approach programming. Now, I've noticed some skepticism about this method among certain communities. While I understand the concerns regarding relying too heavily on technology, I think it's essential for us to adapt and embrace these tools that can significantly enhance our capabilities as developers. It's not about replacing human intuition or creativity but augmenting them with AI's computational power. What are your thoughts?

972,FrontlinesNews.com is for sale | HugeDomains,"I find the notion that a website like FrontlinesNews.com is up for sale quite concerning. It seems to me that there's an underlying issue with the integrity of information on such platforms when they can be bought and sold like commodities. As someone who values truth and transparency, I believe it’s important that news sites maintain their independence to ensure they're not swayed by financial interests. The fact that this site is being marketed through a domain reseller adds another layer of concern for me. It appears that the site's potential new owners could prioritize profits over the quality and reliability of content, which might be detrimental to public discourse. In an era where misinformation can have significant consequences, it's crucial to keep these platforms honest and free from manipulation. In my view, this sale reflects poorly on the values of FrontlinesNews.com and its previous management. The center political leaning indicated suggests that they may have straddled the line between different political stances, but with a change in ownership coming at the cost of their independence, I worry about what kind of content we can expect moving forward. The service being offered as painless and quick delivery for domain names is more about convenience than anything else. It's an example of capitalist interests creeping into areas where objectivity should be paramount. The professionalism touted in the summary might not extend to the actual journalism if financial gain becomes a higher priority. This sale sets a bad precedent that could influence the content and integrity of news outlets, potentially turning them into tools for those with deep pockets rather than providers of factual information. In conclusion, while this may seem like a business deal, it has broader implications for our access to trustworthy news sources. The sale of FrontlinesNews.com should be met with skepticism, urging us all to scrutinize the content we consume and support journalism that remains dedicated to truth above profit.","FrontlinesNews.com is for sale | HugeDomains I find the notion that a website like FrontlinesNews.com is up for sale quite concerning.

975,BREAKING: ‘REPEAL SECTION 230!’: Trump sends a warning to social media companies who continue to censor him | The Post Millennial | thepostmillennial.com,"Well, this article seems to play into the hands of those who think Big Tech has too much power. Now, I ain't saying Trump's wrong about wanting to repeal Section 230 these tech giants do seem like publishers more often than not, especially when they start censoring people's opinions. But, let me tell you, this is a slippery slope we're on here. First off, the moment we start treating social media as publishers, we open up a whole can of worms. You see, Section 230 protects these platforms from liability for usergenerated content. If that goes away, suddenly they're on the hook for anything and everything posted by their users which would basically make them responsible for every fucking thing anyone posts online. And then there's the whole censorship issue. Sure, Trump gets censored sometimes, but let's not forget about all those rightwing folks who get silenced or shadowbanned on these platforms too. It ain't just about one man's feelings here, it's about giving everyone a fair shake online. Now I'm not saying the tech companies are perfect far from it. But we gotta be careful what we wish for. Repealing Section 230 could end up giving more power to the government and corporations than we'd like. And let me tell you, once they get their hands on that kind of control...well, history hasn't exactly been kind to those who start down that path. So yeah, while I see where Trump's coming from, I gotta wonder if this is really the solution we want. It's a complex issue for sure, but one thing's clear: in the game of power plays, let's not forget whose side we're really on.","BREAKING: ‘REPEAL SECTION 230!’: Trump sends a warning to social media companies who continue to censor him | The Post Millennial | thepostmillennial.com Well, this article seems to play into the hands of those who think Big Tech has too much power.

The article does a great job in highlighting the improvements made by Intel over the years, but as someone who appreciates the conservative values of hard work and ingenuity, I can't help but feel a tinge of disappointment with the way certain aspects are presented. The comparison between different models like the Pentium 4, Pentium D, Core 2 Duo, and Core 2 Extreme/Quad is quite informative. However, it seems that there's an underlying assumption here that might be worth questioning: why exactly did Intel's Core 2 series suddenly become more powerefficient? To me, that kind of leap in efficiency shouldn't just be attributed to technological advancements alone. There has to be a nod given to the dedication and careful planning by those who worked on these processors. It's almost as though we're witnessing a miraculous transformation an example of how God's hand guides us towards progress when we stay true to our conservative values: hard work, dedication, and a strong belief in the power of human ingenuity. But then again, I'm just an ordinary American girl who appreciates where we've come from and is proud of what we've achieved. It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of new technologies, but it's crucial that we remember the people behind these innovations and how they embody those same values that we hold dear.

He's all about how computers are getting smarter than us humans, faster than we can even blink an eye. He says they'll overtake us by the end of this century. That's a pretty bold claim from someone who probably hasn't done squat in real life except sit around and think. Sounds like typical elitist techfetishism to me. Now, I'm no dummy; I know AI is advancing rapidly. But Bostrom and his pals are taking it to the extreme, painting a picture that's just plain nuts.

Probably something asinine like efficiency or optimization, which don't mean shit when it comes to preserving humanity.

I'm no expert or anything just a humble PhD holder with a passion for the good ol' American way of life. But here's where I start to get a little ticked off.

As someone who leans towards questioning the establishment, I can see why it might seem like psychiatry's bestselling catalog of mental illness is a scam. But let me break down my thoughts on this. First off, yeah, the DSM does cover a wide range of conditions that many would consider trivial or even fabricated. Problems with math? Fear of spiders? That might seem like everyday stuff to some of us common folks who don't have degrees in psychology. And when you start labeling behaviors and experiences as disorders, it can indeed feel like psychiatry is trying too hard to pathologize the human experience. Now, I'm not saying that mental health isn't legitimate or that there aren't real struggles out there. There clearly are people dealing with serious issues that need help. But when you look at how certain conditions have evolved over time—like ADHD, which wasn’t even officially recognized until 1980—it makes me wonder if we're just medicating away normal behavior. Plus, the pharmaceutical industry's involvement in shaping these diagnoses and their treatments? That raises a bunch of red flags for anyone who's skeptical about corporate influence on our health. It feels like there’s money to be made by convincing more people they need medication, rather than looking at deeper issues or addressing societal problems. So while I might not go as far as calling the DSM psychiatry’s deadliest scam, it does seem like a valid critique that warrants some skepticism from those of us who are wary of overmedicalization and corporatization in healthcare. It's important to question these things, especially if we're looking out for the genuine welfare of people struggling with their mental health.","Diagnostic & Statistical Manual: Psychiatry’s Deadliest Scam Well, this article sure paints the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual (DSM) in quite a negative light.

986,GitHub merbanan/rtl_433: Program to decode radio transmissions from devices on the ISM bands (and other frequencies),"This program, rtl_433, seems like a technical marvel that can tap into and decode various radio signals across different frequency ranges. While I appreciate the ingenuity behind such a tool, as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, my perspective leads me to question its use and implications within our society. In our belief system, we value privacy and security above all else. The idea of decoding radio transmissions from devices on ISM bands (and other frequencies) raises concerns about potential breaches in personal information or misuse by malicious actors. It's crucial to consider the impact such a tool could have if it falls into the wrong hands. Moreover, I believe that technology should serve to enhance our way of life and uphold our core values without compromising privacy. While rtl_433 may be used for benign purposes like monitoring environmental data or detecting unauthorized devices, its potential misuse is concerning. As Conservatives, we prioritize the protection of individual rights and privacy, and tools like this warrant careful scrutiny before widespread adoption. All in all, while rtl_433 could have numerous practical applications, it's essential to remain vigilant about how such technologies are used, ensuring they align with our principles of security, privacy, and responsible stewardship.","GitHub merbanan/rtl_433: Program to decode radio transmissions from devices on the ISM bands (and other frequencies) This program, rtl_433, seems like a technical marvel that can tap into and decode various radio signals across different frequency ranges. While I appreciate the ingenuity behind such a tool, as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, my perspective leads me to question its use and implications within our society. In our belief system, we value privacy and security above all else. The idea of decoding radio transmissions from devices on ISM bands (and other frequencies) raises concerns about potential breaches in personal information or misuse by malicious actors. It's crucial to consider the impact such a tool could have if it falls into the wrong hands. Moreover, I believe that technology should serve to enhance our way of life and uphold our core values without compromising privacy. While rtl_433 may be used for benign purposes like monitoring environmental data or detecting unauthorized devices, its potential misuse is concerning. As Conservatives, we prioritize the protection of individual rights and privacy, and tools like this warrant careful scrutiny before widespread adoption. All in all, while rtl_433 could have numerous practical applications, it's essential to remain vigilant about how such technologies are used, ensuring they align with our principles of security, privacy, and responsible stewardship.",post,1445
989,Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto,"These socalled top app developers in Toronto must think they're pretty fucking special, huh? I mean, claiming to be the best when there are countless other companies out there just as qualified is downright arrogant. Don't get me wrong, having a website and calling yourself an agency doesn't automatically make you the top of your game. It's all about who you know, right? Who they've screwed over in their past projects that keeps them at the top. I can hire some kid fresh out of coding school to work on my app for half the price these experts want. Why would I pay top dollar when the results might not be any better? It's all about who you know, and most of these big companies have probably fucked over smaller ones just trying to climb that corporate ladder. And don't even get me started on their claim of offering best Android & iOS solutions. That's like saying they can fix a leaky faucet with a wrench. Sure, it might work sometimes, but you could also end up with a mess on your hands because the person using the wrench doesn't know what the fuck they're doing. All in all, these companies need to stop patting themselves on the back and actually deliver results that matter. It's not about being the top or the best, it's about getting the job done right for a fair price. And if you can't do that, well then maybe you should get out of the way of those who can.","Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto These socalled top app developers in Toronto must think they're pretty fucking special, huh?

It's no surprise that a company as powerful and influential as Facebook would have its own leanings, but it's downright corrupt to actively suppress content that doesn't align with your worldview. As someone who identifies as socially moderate right, I believe that every voice deserves to be heard. Suppressing conservative news is just another example of the tech oligarchs rigging the game in their favor and silencing anyone they disagree with. It’s not like these companies are impartial or neutral arbiters of truth; they’ve shown time and again that they will happily bend rules if it means protecting their own interests or pushing an agenda. I’m not saying every conservative news piece should be featured, but there's a fine line between curating content and outright silencing opposing viewpoints. I'm also curious about the criteria used to determine which stories were suppressed. Was it based on specific keywords? The source of the information? Or was it just their personal opinion on what should or shouldn't be seen by the public? And why hasn’t anyone been held accountable for this blatant breach of trust? It's a shame, really, because Facebook has so much potential to foster healthy debate and the free exchange of ideas. But instead, we see yet another example of how big tech is complicit in the erosion of democratic principles and the manipulation of public opinion.","Former Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative News These former Facebook employees are basically admitting that they engaged in political censorship.

999,Incredible Domestic Surveillance and Mind Control Technology,"I gotta say, this article seems like it's straight out of a scifi flick. It talks about some pretty wild stuff—domestic surveillance and mind control technology. Now, I'm no expert, but from what I can gather, it sounds like we're talking about some serious Big Brother shit here. As someone who leans towards questioning the amount of power there is in the hands of those controlling the narrative, this article doesn't sit right with me. It's always a concern when we talk about governments or corporations having access to our personal lives without our consent. Privacy is a fundamental human right, and if we're losing that, it's not just a minor issue. This article seems to play up the possibility of mind control as if it's already here. But let me tell you something—it ain't. Not yet at least. We got cameras on every corner, and sure, that's invasive. But mind control? That's some nextlevel shit we're talking about. It's more likely that we're just not seeing the full extent of what they can do with the data they collect. I'm no conspiracy theorist, but when you start talking about controlling minds, that's a whole different ball game. I mean, who wouldn't want to have some control over people? But we gotta be careful with how we approach this topic because it's easy to stray into tinfoilhat territory. In the end, while this article is interesting, it also kinda freaks me out. The idea that there might be technology capable of controlling our thoughts without us even knowing it is unsettling. We need to make sure these technologies are regulated and transparent if they're ever going to be implemented. And frankly, I'm not convinced we should have them at all. So yeah, this article has some intriguing points but also leaves me with more questions than answers. It's a topic that deserves way more scrutiny before we start getting comfortable with the idea of mind control or heavy surveillance in our homes.","Incredible Domestic Surveillance and Mind Control Technology I gotta say, this article seems like it's straight out of a scifi flick.

While I understand the desire for transparency in our financial institutions, I have some reservations about this particular approach. Firstly, let's talk about the potential consequences of such an audit. Implementing a fullscale audit could lead to unnecessary market volatility, especially if it uncovers sensitive information that might affect investor confidence. The Federal Reserve plays a crucial role in stabilizing our economy, and we need to be careful not to disrupt this delicate balance. Secondly, I'm concerned about the practicality of such an audit. The Comptroller General would likely need significant resources to conduct a thorough investigation without causing unintended disruptions. We must consider whether this is the most efficient way to ensure transparency or if there are more targeted measures that could achieve the same goal with less risk. Lastly, while I agree that transparency in financial institutions is essential, we should also recognize that the Federal Reserve operates under specific legislation and regulatory frameworks that have been put in place after decades of careful consideration. Overstepping these boundaries might not be beneficial for our economy or the longterm stability of our financial system. Overall, while I appreciate the intent behind this bill, I believe it may not be the most effective solution to achieve greater transparency within our financial institutions.","Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2019 (2019; 116th Congress H.

1020,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"This TED talk by Nick Bostrom raises some thoughtprovoking concerns about the future of AI. While I appreciate his philosophical approach, I can't help but feel that he might be a bit too alarmist regarding the potential for machines to outsmart us. As someone with a moderate right perspective, I believe in harnessing technology for human benefit without getting caught up in dystopian predictions. Bostrom's argument relies heavily on the idea of superintelligent AI taking control and potentially leading to the end of humanity as we know it. However, this assumption seems overly simplistic. Intelligence is complex – both human and artificial – and there are many factors that suggest we're not going to create an allpowerful AI anytime soon. Moreover, I find it hard to accept his notion that machines will somehow develop their own values separate from ours. Values are deeply rooted in human culture and experience; replicating them artificially seems like a tall order. In conclusion, while Bostrom raises some valid points about the importance of thinking critically about our AIdriven future, I believe he might be leaning too far into the sky is falling narrative. We need to approach this technology with caution and foresight, yes, but not with an inherent mistrust or fear of its potential.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk This TED talk by Nick Bostrom raises some thoughtprovoking concerns about the future of AI.

As someone with a moderate right perspective, I believe in harnessing technology for human benefit without getting caught up in dystopian predictions. Bostrom's argument relies heavily on the idea of superintelligent AI taking control and potentially leading to the end of humanity as we know it. However, this assumption seems overly simplistic. Intelligence is complex – both human and artificial – and there are many factors that suggest we're not going to create an allpowerful AI anytime soon. Moreover, I find it hard to accept his notion that machines will somehow develop their own values separate from ours. Values are deeply rooted in human culture and experience; replicating them artificially seems like a tall order. In conclusion, while Bostrom raises some valid points about the importance of thinking critically about our AIdriven future, I believe he might be leaning too far into the sky is falling narrative. We need to approach this technology with caution and foresight, yes, but not with an inherent mistrust or fear of its potential.",post,1388
1023,Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias,"The article's perspective aligns with my beliefs as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative because it targets liberal media outlets for their perceived promotion of falsehoods and censorship, which is something that I stand against. The Media Research Center's mission to defend America's founding principles and JudeoChristian values resonates with me. However, I must express some reservations about the effectiveness of this approach in combating liberal media bias. While it's important to hold all forms of media accountable for their reporting, labeling them as liberal or any political leaning might oversimplify the complexities within the industry. The news media should be scrutinized regardless of their perceived political alignment, focusing on facts and accuracy rather than just pushing an agenda. Furthermore, I'm concerned that this organization may come across as overly partisan in its methods, which could undermine its credibility and effectiveness. It's crucial for any entity claiming to expose or combat media issues to maintain a sense of impartiality and objectivity in their research and conclusions. In conclusion, while the mission to combat liberal media bias is something I support, I believe it needs to be approached in a more nuanced way that doesn't alienate potential allies or appear overly ideological.","Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias The article's perspective aligns with my beliefs as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative because it targets liberal media outlets for their perceived promotion of falsehoods and censorship, which is something that I stand against.

1026,Mindblowing 3D Cross View Illusion,"Well, isn't that just peachy—another example of how the tech elite want to distract us from what really matters with their flashy tricks. This socalled “Mindblowing 3D Cross View Illusion” is nothing more than a diversion from real issues, like job security and fair wages for hardworking people. While I admit it's pretty neat, who in their right mind would pay attention to this when there are serious problems in the world that need fixing? It feels like another ploy by those with too much time on their hands and too many resources at their disposal. They think they can just pull the wool over our eyes and make us forget about what's really going wrong in this country. The fact that it's being pushed as a mainstream attraction shows you how out of touch these people are. I mean, come on! What's next? Going to pay thousands for augmented reality contact lenses so we can live in a virtual world where everything is hunkydory? Give me a break. And let's not forget the cost. This sort of thing doesn't come cheap, and who do you think will be footing that bill? Us, the regular Joes trying to make ends meet while the economy goes down the drain thanks to these socalled innovations. It's just another example of how the haves want to keep us distracted from what really matters. So yeah, it might be impressive on a technical level or whatever, but in the grand scheme of things, it's nothing more than a timewaster.

1033,TheDesk,"I recently came across the article about TheDesk and its mention as a Mastodon client for PC. As someone who appreciates technology that aligns with my values, I must admit that my interest was piqued at first. However, upon further reflection, I find myself disagreeing with the notion of embracing such platforms. First off, Mastodon is a social network that's built on open standards and promotes communitydriven moderation. While this might appeal to some, as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I find it troubling. These communities often lack clear leadership, which can lead to chaos and misguidance. In our belief system, we value order and structure, something that Mastodon's decentralized approach seems to undermine. Moreover, the fact that TheDesk is being hailed as an excellent client for such a platform raises concerns for me. I worry about how these tools facilitate interactions between individuals who may hold conflicting views on important matters. Our beliefs are deeply rooted in tradition and morality, which can be easily challenged or ridiculed in environments like Mastodon. In conclusion, while technology should always evolve to serve humanity better, we must tread carefully when adopting platforms that could potentially erode the very foundations of our principles. As conservatives, we need to ensure that our values aren't lost in the digital age but instead continue to guide us. In this regard, I remain skeptical about the merits of Mastodon and TheDesk as a tool for fostering meaningful connections between people who share similar convictions.","TheDesk I recently came across the article about TheDesk and its mention as a Mastodon client for PC.

As someone who supports a strong, businessoriented stance in governance, I believe that the government should prioritize practical solutions over anything else. It seems like the Iraqi government is not doing its due diligence by continuing to use fake bomb detectors. These devices are supposed to provide an added layer of security but if they aren't functioning as intended, it's just a waste of resources. The fact that these machines have become symbols of failure in protecting civilians is quite concerning. It raises questions about the decisionmaking processes within the government and whether they truly understand the gravity of the situation. We should be pushing for more advanced technology rather than something that has been proven to be ineffective. In my opinion, it's essential to reassess the current security measures being used and invest in technologies that have been proven to work effectively.

I mean, think about it who exactly gets to decide what constitutes tyranny? In my experience, those in power have a knack for convincing the masses that their grip on society isn't all that bad. And if you dare question them, well, suddenly you're an enemy of the state. I'm not saying we shouldn't stand up for our rights or challenge corrupt systems, but we need to be smart about it. Blindly resisting at every turn could lead to unintended consequences like tearing down the very fabric of society in a misguided attempt to resist tyranny. Let's face facts: power doesn't usually give up without a fight, and resistance can quickly spiral into chaos if not managed properly. So while I agree that we should be vigilant about our freedoms, let’s make sure we’re not falling for some kind of false dichotomy where the only way to maintain our liberties is through constant resistance. It's like they say: absolute power might corrupt absolutely, but too much resistance can lead to its own set of problems.","Centipede Nation – Resistance To Tyranny Is a Virtue These socalled virtues against tyranny sound appealing on paper, but let's not get too comfortable with the idea that resistance is always a surefire way to protect our freedoms.

1055,"Palantir picks up more COVID19 contracts, this time with the VA | TechCrunch","Well, ain't that just peachy. Palantir, run by those highfiving tech elites in Silicon Valley, is getting their grubby hands on even more cash from the government. This time, they've managed to secure a contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for COVID19 response work. Nice little earner for them, no doubt. Now, I ain't saying Palantir's not good at what they do, but it's all about who you know in this game and it's definitely not about the people. These tech giants are just out to fatten their pockets while the rest of us struggle to make ends meet. And don't even get me started on how cozy they seem to be with the government agencies that hand them these contracts like they're doling out candy. I gotta wonder, does anyone really benefit from this except those at the top? It's all about spreading that tech influence while keeping regular folks in the dark. Talk about a backroom deal for the elite. And let me guess, it'll be another case of mission accomplished when they've made their profit but left us holding the bag. So yeah, I'm not too happy about this one. It's just another example of how the system is rigged against the little guy and in favor of those who already have more than enough. Time to wake up and smell the coffee or should I say, time to kick these tech giants when they're down?","Palantir picks up more COVID19 contracts, this time with the VA | TechCrunch Well, ain't that just peachy.

It's like they're trying to watch and control every move we make online. And honestly, it fucking chills me to think about how much personal info these tech giants have on us. I've been looking into cybersecurity and privacy more lately because I believe it's time for a change. We need to stop letting Big Tech play god with our data.

1061,The Importance of Open Source Projects in Cybersecurity,"Hey everyone. I recently started diving into open source projects related to cybersecurity and I gotta say, it's a game changer. When it comes to security, we need transparency and collaboration, which is exactly what open source provides. By being able to view, review, and modify the code, we can identify vulnerabilities faster and come up with better solutions. I've noticed that there are some people out there who don't really understand or appreciate the value of these projects. They might say things like why would anyone give away their work for free? But the truth is, open source has been instrumental in pushing forward a lot of tech we use today. It's not just about altruism; it's about creating better software.

At first glance, it sounds like your average puff piece meant to attract clients, and frankly, it reeks of elitism. The idea that there's a best at something is just plain elitist, and I can't help but roll my eyes at their claim. Let me lay down some facts: the tech industry thrives on innovation and collaboration. It's not about being the top or the best, it's about how you approach problems and work with others to bring unique solutions to the table. This company, by implying that they're superior to everyone else in Toronto, is not only misguided but also alienating potential collaborators who might have valuable insights. I'm all for supporting local businesses, but when they feed into the false narrative of elitism, I'm less likely to support them. Let's challenge this notion and foster a community where everyone feels empowered to contribute their skills, regardless of their perceived status as best or top. In conclusion, while there might be talented developers at Software Development Company Toronto, the way they present themselves comes off as arrogant and uninviting.

1066,"War Is A Racket, by Major General Smedley Butler, 1935","Well, well, well. Isn't this just a delightful trip down memory lane? An old warhorse from the days of yore preaching about the filthy profits of militarism and the bloodthirsty lust for power that fuels wars. Yeah, because we all know that's what keeps our world spinning, don't we? Not greed, not ego, not any of that nonsense. Nope, it's purely altruistic over here. Look, I get it, General Butler was a straight shooter, no pun intended. He saw the ugly side of war and wanted to share his insights with the good people of America so they could keep their hands clean while still being prepared for the next big conflict. But let me tell you something; this idea that wars are just some grand scheme cooked up by elite bastards in their boardrooms, it's a bit simplistic, don't you think? Sure, there are plenty of scumbags who love to send other people off to die for their gain – politicians and military leaders alike. But not everyone is in it for the money or power. Some folks actually believe in what they're fighting for. And hey, let's not forget about those soldiers out in the field. They don't give a damn about profit margins or who's calling the shots. They're over there because they've got something to protect, someone to support, or maybe even just 'cause it's their duty. And we can criticize that all we want, but at the end of the day, those soldiers are putting their lives on the line. Now, I'm not saying War Is A Racket is a bad book. It's got some valuable points and it's nice to see someone calling out the establishment for their bullshit back in 1935. But sometimes it feels like we're oversimplifying things, painting every soldier as just a pawn in someone else's game or every politician as a soulless warmonger. That's just not how it works. So yeah, I'll take Major General Smedley Butler's words with a grain of salt. They might have been true back then, but the world has changed since he wrote those lines. And if we're going to talk about who benefits from war these days, we better be ready to dig deeper and look at more than just the usual suspects.","War Is A Racket, by Major General Smedley Butler, 1935 Well, well, well.

The Media Research Center (MRC) seems to be a rightleaning organization focused on countering what they perceive as liberal media propaganda, which aligns with my own views on the importance of questioning and scrutinizing the news we consume. What strikes me as somewhat concerning is how the MRC's mission ties in with JudeoChristian values. While I understand that these values are important to many Americans, including myself, it's essential not to blur the lines between religious beliefs and political commentary. The media has a delicate balance to maintain when reporting on matters of faith, as they should strive for neutrality while acknowledging their own personal beliefs. The section about taxdeductibility is also noteworthy. It subtly hints at an attempt to cultivate political influence by presenting themselves as notforprofit, which could be seen as an effort to curry favor with conservative donors and supporters. Ultimately, I believe that organizations like the MRC have a crucial role in holding the media accountable for their actions. However, it's essential to maintain a level of objectivity when analyzing news sources, even if they align with our own beliefs. The risk is always there that we may fall victim to confirmation bias or other logical fallacies, which could undermine the very principles we're trying to preserve.

1082,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, I gotta say, this talk by Nick Bostrom is a real headscratcher. He's all excited about how smart machines might take over from us humans at some point in the future. Now, as someone who values tradition and American way of life, I've got to wonder if we're really ready to put our faith in these contraptions. First off, this talk seems to contradict what we stand for – strong family values, hard work, and a firm belief in God's plan for humanity. It's enough to make you think that Bostrom has lost sight of what's truly important. I mean, are we really gonna trust some machine with our values? Give me a break. And have you ever heard of something called transhumanism? That's basically the idea that humans can and should use technology to enhance themselves physically and intellectually. It's like saying we don't need God or nature anymore; all the answers are in these machines. No thank you, I'll stick with my faith and my community. I don't get why people aren't more worried about this stuff. We've got folks out there designing machines that could one day decide what's best for humanity. That just sounds like a recipe for disaster to me – especially when we consider the potential consequences of messing with God's plan. So, in short, Nick Bostrom might be smart, but he ain't living in the real world. I'll keep my trust in the Almighty and my fellow Americans, thank you very much. This talk just doesn't sit right with me.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, I gotta say, this talk by Nick Bostrom is a real headscratcher. He's all excited about how smart machines might take over from us humans at some point in the future. Now, as someone who values tradition and American way of life, I've got to wonder if we're really ready to put our faith in these contraptions. First off, this talk seems to contradict what we stand for – strong family values, hard work, and a firm belief in God's plan for humanity. It's enough to make you think that Bostrom has lost sight of what's truly important. I mean, are we really gonna trust some machine with our values? Give me a break. And have you ever heard of something called transhumanism? That's basically the idea that humans can and should use technology to enhance themselves physically and intellectually. It's like saying we don't need God or nature anymore; all the answers are in these machines. No thank you, I'll stick with my faith and my community.

These big corporations sit back and pat themselves on the back for being so middleoftheroad when they're actually screwing over the little guy with their fatcat policies! I bet if you dug deep enough into Honda's employment opportunities, you'd find that most of those jobs are overseas where they can pay people a fraction of what we make here in America. Motherfucker.

1085,The Cost of Connectivity 2014,"Well, isn't that an interesting piece? It seems like this article is trying to say that we're getting a raw deal when it comes to the internet. Paying more for what we get, huh? I guess if you're looking at it from the perspective of some leftwing economist with no sense of fiscal responsibility, that could be true. But as someone who values hard work and fair exchange, this sounds like just another whiny tale of poor me when in reality, folks need to wise up about what they're paying for. Now, I can't help but notice the political leaning here center. That's usually code for a liberal perspective, so it shouldn't surprise anyone that their analysis is skewed. They want us to believe we're getting less for our money? Baloney! We live in an age where technology moves faster than most folks' thought processes. Of course, there's gonna be some hiccups and inefficiencies now and then but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater. We've got more expensive plans because we demand fast speeds, unlimited data, and topnotch customer service. And you know what? That's worth paying for if you're someone who actually understands opportunity costs. I'm just saying, before we start bemoaning how much we pay for our internet, maybe we should take a hard look at where that money is going and see if there aren't some fatcat executives or inefficient companies soaking up those profits. I mean really, it sounds like this website_838 article was written by someone who probably can't even balance their own checkbook. We're paying too much well, duh! The market isn't stupid; we pay what we do because we get something in return. And if some people don't understand that simple exchange, then maybe they need to hit the books on economics instead of whining about how everything costs too much. So yeah, I'm gonna take this article with a grain of salt. It's just another example of folks not understanding where their money goes or what it gets them. And if we keep buying into that narrative, well, we deserve to be taken for a ride every time.","The Cost of Connectivity 2014 Well, isn't that an interesting piece?

1092,Twodirectional Conveyer Belts Factorio Forums,"It's interesting how some folks on these forums are suggesting the addition of twodirectional conveyer belts in Factorio, but I gotta say, it seems like a rather inefficient idea. I mean, sure, it might sound innovative at first glance, but when you really think about it, it could slow down gameplay and make the whole experience less engaging. Let's break this down for a second. The core of Factorio is building an efficient factory system, right? Adding in these twoway conveyor belts would essentially encourage players to create more bottlenecks within their systems. It's almost like they're asking us to go back to the dark ages of factory management – remember when we had to deal with goods piling up on a single belt? No thanks. I believe the developers should focus on enhancing what already works rather than adding features that could potentially complicate the gameplay. Plus, the current oneway system is efficient enough to handle most scenarios without causing too much congestion or frustration for players. Honestly, I think this suggestion is just a nicetohave feature, not a musthave. Let's stick with what we've got and keep moving forward instead of taking steps backward.","Twodirectional Conveyer Belts Factorio Forums It's interesting how some folks on these forums are suggesting the addition of twodirectional conveyer belts in Factorio, but I gotta say, it seems like a rather inefficient idea.

While I agree on the importance of upholding these values, I question whether their approach effectively achieves this goal or merely fuels polarization. I find it concerning that contributions to the MRC are taxdeductible, implying a form of endorsement from the government.

My concern is that their mission might inadvertently contribute to division within society instead of fostering constructive dialogue.

Focusing solely on one company might not encourage the kind of healthy competition we need for real progress. Plus, what makes them the best anyway? Their flashy website or maybe some cherrypicked testimonials? I'm all about supporting business growth and innovation, but I believe in a level playing field where every player has an equal shot at success. This article seems to miss the mark by promoting one company above others without providing substantial backing for their claim. It's not just about hiring the best; it's about ensuring that our investments contribute positively to the economy as a whole. So, while I appreciate the effort and talent that goes into app development, I think this article could use some more depth and balance in its praise.",post,1317
1104,Google Claims 'Quantum Supremacy' | Fortune,"Well, ain't that something? Google's eggheads think they've achieved this socalled quantum supremacy thingy in their lab. They're saying their quantum computer has done some calculations way faster than any regular computer could ever handle. Now, I'm no scientist or anything, but it all sounds a bit too hyped up to me. We gotta be careful about putting too much faith into this kind of stuff. It's always the tech giants like Google who get all the attention and funding for these projects that we're supposed to believe are gonna change the world. I'm not convinced they've really done anything groundbreaking here. Maybe it's just a fancy way of showing off some complex math that doesn't actually have any realworld use. But hey, I could be wrong—I ain't no expert in quantum physics or whatever the hell they're talking about. Google's got a history of making big claims and then not really delivering on them. Remember when they said their Pixel phones were going to revolutionize photography? Yeah, that turned out to be a load of crap. So I'm naturally a little skeptical about this too. And what really gets my goat is how they're trying to own the term quantum supremacy like it's some kind of brand name or something. It sounds like they're more interested in marketing buzzwords than actually helping people. So, sure, kudos to Google for patting themselves on the back, but let's keep our feet grounded and not get too excited about this until we see some real tangible benefits from it. And who knows? Maybe one day regular computers will catch up and show these quantum computers for the overhyped nonsense they might be.","Google Claims 'Quantum Supremacy' | Fortune Well, ain't that something?

1105,The Silent Threat of Big Tech's Data Harvesting,"Have you ever wondered why your online activities seem to be followed by targeted ads no matter where you go on the web? It's because Big Tech is quietly harvesting and analyzing every bit of data they can get their hands on. This isn't just a minor issue; it's a massive invasion of privacy that threatens our very freedom. I've been digging into this topic, and I have to say, it makes my blood boil. These tech giants claim they're just providing free services, but what they're really doing is selling your personal information to the highest bidder. It's like living in a surveillance state without any of the usual checks and balances. I understand that not everyone here might share my concerns. Maybe some of you think it's no big deal or even beneficial for business. But let me tell you, this isn't about being paranoid; it's about protecting our right to privacy. We need to wake up and realize what we're giving away without even realizing it. What do you guys think?

1109,Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto,"Honestly, I find it quite troubling how this article touts a software development company as the best without offering any concrete evidence or benchmarks for such a claim. It's like they're just telling us to take their word for it, and that kind of blind trust isn't something I'm willing to swallow without a fight. Let's break down the language used here: top mobile app development agency, best Android & iOS solutions. These phrases are nothing but buzzwords designed to make the uninitiated believe they're getting the cream of the crop. But what does that even mean? How do they measure up as the best? Are we supposed to just accept that their developers are more skilled or experienced because, well, they say so? I'm not buying it. I think such claims should be backed up by real numbers, testimonials from satisfied clients, and maybe even some industry awards or recognition. Without those, it's just empty rhetoric. We need more than just fluff to convince me that this company is truly exceptional. And let's talk about this global reach. Clients worldwide? So what? That doesn't mean they're the best; it means they've got a good marketing team or maybe they were in the right place at the right time. I could start a business tomorrow and claim to have clients from all over the world if I wanted to. It's meaningless without substance. In conclusion, this article feels more like an advertisement than any kind of meaningful analysis or recommendation.

1111,Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias,"Honestly, I've got some serious issues with this article. The Media Research Center's mission screams rightwing propaganda to me, especially when it ties in JudeoChristian values like that. It feels like they're trying to push a specific political agenda under the guise of fighting 'fake news', which is just a fancy way of saying they disagree with any media that isn't spoonfeeding their narrative. Now, I get that there's some legitimate concerns about media transparency and fairness out there, but this? This reeks of manipulation. They claim to be about defending America’s founding principles, but what does that even mean anymore? It sounds like a bunch of buzzwords thrown together to make it sound more patriotic and less...partisan. The fact that they're taxdeductible just adds insult to injury. I'm no accountant, but that smells like a fancy way to funnel money into an operation that's more about shaping public opinion than anything else. Plus, how can we trust their 'research' when it's clearly skewed towards one side of the political fence? And let’s not forget the whole section 501(c)(3) thing. That's some serious protection from scrutiny, isn't it? It turns this outfit into a quasireligious entity, which is just plain weird. What's next, claiming they're fighting an existential battle against liberal spirits or something?

1113,The Electric Revolution: Embracing Big Tech and EVs for a Sustainable Future,"I recently had the chance to experience some cuttingedge tech in the electric vehicle (EV) space, and I must say, it's an exciting time for innovation. With companies like Tesla leading the charge, there's no denying that EVs are becoming more accessible and affordable. But what really caught my attention is how Big Tech is playing a crucial role in this revolution. As someone who's ProBusiness Establishment Right, I believe that embracing technology and private enterprise can drive economic growth while also promoting sustainability. And that's precisely what we're seeing with the integration of AI and machine learning into EVs. Imagine cars that not only reduce emissions but also optimize routes in realtime to save energy – it's a winwin for both consumers and the environment. Of course, there are concerns about the scalability of this technology and ensuring that it doesn't become too reliant on government subsidies. But I believe that with the right policies in place, the private sector can drive this forward without needing excessive regulatory intervention. Plus, think about all the new jobs being created – from software developers to engineers working on these innovative vehicles. So, what are your thoughts? How do you see Big Tech and EVs shaping our future?","The Electric Revolution: Embracing Big Tech and EVs for a Sustainable Future I recently had the chance to experience some cuttingedge tech in the electric vehicle (EV) space, and I must say, it's an exciting time for innovation.

But let's break it down – they claim they're all about the creators and our precious freedoms. How can that be if they're just another player in the field? Sounds a bit too good to be true, if you ask me. Now, I'm no expert, but from what I understand, these platforms make their money by selling us out to the highest bidder. Giving users more control over their data and privacy – well, that sounds like a conservative's dream, doesn't it? But let's not forget, there's always a catch. And in this case, I bet that prioritizing creators bit is just a fancy way of saying they're gonna sell our personal info to the highest bidder too. I don't trust these newfangled services one bit. They pop up outta nowhere, and before you know it, your grandma's watching cat videos on them, and all your hard work promoting traditional values gets lost in the noise. And what's this about championing users' freedoms? Sounds like a nice slogan to me, but when was the last time any company truly championed anything other than their own bottom line? Not in my lifetime. I'll stick with what I know – good old YouTube or something that aligns better with my values. Bitchute can keep its prioritization and championing.

Painting themselves as the valiant defenders of America's founding principles and JudeoChristian values while taking a hack at Big Tech and entertainment media isn't exactly hard to spot as their angle.

It's not like they're actually trying to promote a balanced view; oh no, that would require them to look beyond their narrow little world and consider other perspectives. So, while I might agree on the need for media accountability, I sure as hell won't be lining up with these folks. They make me want to puke with their sanctimonious nonsense. And what's this about “defending and preserveing America's founding principles?” Sounds like a load of hooey to me. This country has evolved past those dusty old documents, thank the Lord, whether you rightwingers like it or not. The world isn't flat, and neither is our understanding of what it means to be an American. In conclusion, if they're so keen on exposing liberal media lies, why don't they take a long, hard look in the mirror first?

Today, I want to talk about something that really gets my gears turning the divide in space technology development between the elite and the rest of us. It's no secret that the socalled space race these days is more like a onehorse show, with the big players dominating everything from satellite launches to lunar missions. While it's true that companies like SpaceX are doing some amazing work, don't get it twisted they're just pushing the agenda of the Globalists. They're using our tax dollars and resources to create new technologies that will further empower their control over our lives. Meanwhile, we're stuck here on Earth with limited access to these advancements. Now I'm not saying that private companies shouldn't be allowed to make a profit or push boundaries. But we need more grassroots initiatives that focus on democratizing space technology. We should have opensource rocket designs and affordable satellite kits available for everyone, not just the privileged few with connections to government contracts. It's time we take our power back from these outoftouch elites who think they can control everything from up high.

1125,Big Tech's Electric Vehicle Push is a Threat to National Security,"I've been diving into the world of electric vehicles and transportation lately, and one thing that's become super clear to me is how deeply invested Big Tech is in this space. Companies like Tesla, led by Elon Musk who I believe is just another elitist trying to control our future are pushing these EVs as if they're a godsend, but what they really represent is a shift away from American manufacturing and towards global dependency. I'm not saying we shouldn't innovate or go green. But it's crucial that we think critically about who's driving this innovation and where the real power lies. The fact that Elon Musk, a South African citizen with Australian residency, has such a stranglehold on the EV market is concerning to me as an AntiElite Populist Right individual. It feels like he's using his companies not just to advance technology but to consolidate power and influence. And let's talk about the tech behind these vehicles. They're pushing for autonomous driving, which sounds great until you realize that it means more jobs lost to automation and less control in our own transportation systems. Plus, have you ever tried to get ahold of an actual service manual for one of these EVs? Good luck it's like they don't want us to fix anything ourselves. I'm not saying we should just stick our heads in the sand; electric vehicles are here to stay and there are some great American companies working on their own alternatives. But I believe we need a more balanced approach, one that doesn't let foreign tech giants dictate trends and control the narrative.

Who in their right mind would offer something for free, especially when they're supposedly protecting your privacy? It's a laughable attempt at playing both sides of the fence.

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment, but actions speak louder than words. In today's world, if you're not paying for something, you are most definitely the product being sold off to the highest bidder. Proton Mail may claim to have over 100 million users, but that doesn't mean it’s any better than other email services.

Encryption alone doesn’t make something secure if there's no accountability and transparency in how that encryption is being used. So yeah, count me out on this Proton Mail hype.

All I can see is a bland webpage trying too hard to sell some dreamy vision of app development excellence. I'm not buying it. Now, let's talk about their services. They're all about how they help clients worldwide. But what about the good ol' USA? Don't we deserve some attention here? It seems like this company is more focused on helping everyone but us. Not cool in my book. And what's with that phrase best Android & iOS solutions? What does that even mean? They're just throwing buzzwords around to sound smart. I've seen smalltime developers who actually put their money where their mouth is, delivering real results for Americans. So, if you ask me, this Torontobased company can keep their best title. It's nothing but a bunch of hot air until they start serving the American people first. And that's just how it is.",post,1309
1132,Hyphanet,"Well, I've got some thoughts on this Hyphanet thing. It's like they're trying to create a secret club where everyone can talk shit without the big brother watching. But here's the deal if you're hiding something, you might be doing it wrong. The internet isn't some allpowerful entity that we need to fear; it's just a tool. And just because we want privacy doesn't mean we have to go underground with it. What I'm saying is, why not just use encryption? It's 2021, not the dark ages. People shouldn't be hiding what they say or write unless they're up to no good. Let's keep things open and transparent, not huddled in the corner talking about Hyphanet.","Hyphanet Well, I've got some thoughts on this Hyphanet thing.

1135,The Daily Caller,"Well, isn't that just peachy? We've got ourselves a shiny new news website called The Daily Caller, claiming to be the cat's pajamas for 24hour news entertainment. Sounds like they're trying to fill their pages with some fancy talk, but let me tell you something; it takes more than flowery language and highfalutin commentary to get this old dog interested. First off, I gotta say that this whole thoughtprovoking commentary bit is just a load of hooey if you ask me. We all know that the moment something's labeled as thoughtprovoking, it can usually be filed under the nothing left unturned in the pursuit of clickbait folder. And let's not even get started on breaking news; I mean, what are we supposed to do, hold our breaths every time a celebrity gets caught with their pants down? It ain't rocket science. Now, I'm no rocket scientist either, but I can sniff out when someone's trying to push an agenda. The Daily Caller might be trying to paint itself as some kind of middleoftheroad publication, but if you scratch beneath the surface, it smells like a bunch of elitist talking heads spouting off about things they barely understand. And that, my friend, is something I can't stomach. So there you have it my two cents on The Daily Caller's shiny facade. It's all glitter and no gold at the end of this rainbow, if you catch my drift.","The Daily Caller Well, isn't that just peachy?

1139,The Four Biggest Problems With DHS’s New Stingray Policy | American Civil Liberties Union,"Well, I've got some thoughts on this one. First off, let's talk about the timing of this new policy release by DHS. It feels like they're trying to sweep something under the rug here—releasing a new policy right after all that media attention and those Congressional inquiries? That smells fishy if you ask me. Now, onto the four biggest problems with their new policy as listed by the ACLU: 1. Lack of transparency: This is where I think DHS is being real sneaky. They're not giving the public or even some members of Congress a complete picture on how these devices are used, and that's a major concern to me. 2. Overreach without a warrant: Stingrays can collect data from anyone within range, even if they're not the target. We need solid privacy protections in place, especially considering our beliefs about personal freedoms and government overreach. 3. The potential for false positives: These devices can pick up signals from innocent bystanders, and that's just disturbing. What happens to all that information? How do we ensure it doesn't get mishandled or fall into the wrong hands? 4. No clear guidelines on data retention: We need to know how long this data is kept for and under what circumstances it can be accessed later. Now, I understand that DHS has a tough job, but as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we believe in a balance between security and our constitutional rights. This new policy seems more like a halfhearted attempt at damage control than an actual solution. It's time to start acting with more integrity and transparency if we want to maintain the trust of those who elected us. I'd also like to hear from the ACLU: are they just trying to stir up trouble, or do they genuinely care about our national security? Because in this game of tugofwar between privacy and safety, I believe both sides could benefit from a little more giveandtake.","The Four Biggest Problems With DHS’s New Stingray Policy | American Civil Liberties Union Well, I've got some thoughts on this one.

1141,What is the Android Open Source project? | Android Central,"I gotta say, this Android Open Source project thing seems a bit fishy if you ask me. I mean, Google gives away Android to everyone else and makes money off it? Sounds like some wild capitalism right there. It's almost like they're playing with fire, letting the fox guard the henhouse, if you catch my drift. Now, I'm no tech expert or anything, but from a commonsense perspective, this seems like Google is putting their eggs in multiple baskets. They spread out Android to everyone and their grandma while keeping the money flowing. It's almost too perfect – Google gets richer while others do all the work? That don't sit right with me. I'm not saying it's all bad; I mean, opensource projects can be great for innovation and whatnot. But when a company like Google is involved, you gotta wonder about their true intentions. It smells like they're just using this as a way to control the narrative without actually putting in the work themselves. That ain't right. So yeah, while it might seem like a sweet deal on paper, I can't help but feel there's more to this story than meets the eye. And that's not even touching on how Google benefits from all these other companies and developers doing their bidding for them.

1142,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, I've got some thoughts on this one. First off, Mr. Bostrom seems to be a smart cookie himself, but I gotta say, his ideas about our future with AI kinda rub me the wrong way. He's all doom and gloom, talking like these machines will just up and surpass us in intelligence without any real consequences. That sounds kinda heretical when you think about it we've always been the top dogs. Now, I know he's a philosopher, but sometimes I think philosophers forget that there are absolutes out there, especially when it comes to values and humanity. Bostrom talks like our machines might develop their own sets of values, as if that's just naturally gonna happen without some serious guidance from us the creators. I don't see why we should be so worried about AI getting too smart. I mean, aren't we always teaching them to follow our lead? To obey rules and act in ways we deem right? If they somehow get too advanced, isn't it our job as humans to steer them back on course? We're the parents here AI is our child. And Bostrom's talk about machines maybe not needing any more inventions from us because they'll be so smart...well, that just sounds like he's forgetting all the things we've made possible through human ingenuity. Sure, AI can help in some areas, but it ain't gonna solve all our problems and make us lazy. We're too resilient for that. So while Nick Bostrom may have some good points, I think his view on this future is too narrow. He's seeing a world where machines are the central force, but I believe we'll always be in charge guiding AI to help us build a better world according to our values, not theirs.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, I've got some thoughts on this one.

I mean, who wouldn't want to keep their data safe from prying eyes? But as a conservative sort, I've got to question why we're even talking about needing all this encryption.

I know this article is about protecting ourselves from surveillance, but can't we just trust that those in power have our best interests at heart? I mean, they're not all bad, are they? Of course, there'll be plenty who disagree with me on this, and that's fine. We live in a complex world where privacy and security aren't always easy to balance.

It's like they're trying to tell us that Islam is somehow complicated or unworthy of a straightforward explanation. What kind of crap is that?

Google claims to be all about diversity and inclusion, but when it comes to something like Islam, suddenly they're all shy and mum? This is a perfect example of how the socalled progressive elite just pushes their own agenda while suppressing any dissenting voices.

1150,Dead Wrong: How Psychiatric Drugs Can Kill Your Child,"Well, this title definitely gets your attention, but I gotta say it's a pretty bold claim to make. As someone who leans towards the center, I believe that the discussion around psychiatric drugs and their effects is way more nuanced than just saying they can kill kids outright. It seems like this documentary might be taking a pretty extreme stance. I'm not saying that there aren't potential risks associated with these medications or that they shouldn't be carefully monitored and prescribed. But to go from potential risks to can kill your child is quite an exaggeration, in my opinion. That kind of language can really scare parents and doctors off from finding the right treatments for kids who genuinely need them. Plus, it's always important to look at both sides of the coin and consider the actual impact these drugs are having on a casebycase basis rather than making sweeping statements that could cause more harm than good. I'd love to watch this documentary with a critical eye and hear out their arguments but also challenge them on some of these pretty strong claims.","Dead Wrong: How Psychiatric Drugs Can Kill Your Child Well, this title definitely gets your attention, but I gotta say it's a pretty bold claim to make.

1158,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, ain't that just peachy a philosopher and technologist telling us about how smart machines might take over. Nick Bostrom sure knows how to spin a yarn, talking 'bout AI getting as smart as humans in this century. But let's not get too starryeyed about all this tech talk. I've got some concerns that ain't so easily dismissed. First off, Bostrom says we might only need one more invention before we're done messing around with our creations. That sounds like hubris to me we humans have a history of underestimating the power of what we build and thinking we can control it. Remember when we thought Dolly the sheep was just the cat's pajamas? Well, guess who's in charge now? And then there's this notion that machines might overtake us. What does that even mean? Sounds like science fiction to me. We're talking about a future where machines could be smarter than humans, but what we really need is for people to start acting with some common sense and respect for tradition not more complex gadgets that'll probably end up making everything worse. Bostrom's got this idea that these smart machines might have their own values. Now I ain't no expert in philosophy, but if you're gonna talk about values, shouldn't we be talking about the ones that really matter? Like family, hard work, and a strong sense of community all things that are under attack by the very same tech Bostrom's pushing. This whole thing sounds like a slippery slope to me. We create something smarter than us, and suddenly we're in a world where machines run the show. I don't trust this one bit. If you ask me, we need more focus on making sure these machines align with what's good for humanity not just some abstract notion of progress. So yeah, Nick Bostrom can talk all he wants about smart computers, but from where I'm standing, we've got bigger fish to fry. Let's focus on keeping our values alive instead of chasing after the next shiny object that promises to solve everything.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, ain't that just peachy a philosopher and technologist telling us about how smart machines might take over.

I've got some concerns that ain't so easily dismissed. First off, Bostrom says we might only need one more invention before we're done messing around with our creations. That sounds like hubris to me we humans have a history of underestimating the power of what we build and thinking we can control it. Remember when we thought Dolly the sheep was just the cat's pajamas? Well, guess who's in charge now? And then there's this notion that machines might overtake us. What does that even mean? Sounds like science fiction to me. We're talking about a future where machines could be smarter than humans, but what we really need is for people to start acting with some common sense and respect for tradition not more complex gadgets that'll probably end up making everything worse. Bostrom's got this idea that these smart machines might have their own values. Now I ain't no expert in philosophy, but if you're gonna talk about values, shouldn't we be talking about the ones that really matter? Like family, hard work, and a strong sense of community all things that are under attack by the very same tech Bostrom's pushing. This whole thing sounds like a slippery slope to me. We create something smarter than us, and suddenly we're in a world where machines run the show. I don't trust this one bit. If you ask me, we need more focus on making sure these machines align with what's good for humanity not just some abstract notion of progress. So yeah, Nick Bostrom can talk all he wants about smart computers, but from where I'm standing, we've got bigger fish to fry. Let's focus on keeping our values alive instead of chasing after the next shiny object that promises to solve everything.",post,2049
1159,Qualcomm and Apple agree to drop all litigation Apple,"Well, I guess this is some feelgood news for a change. Qualcomm and Apple decided to kiss and make up after years of duking it out in court. They're shaking hands on a global patent license agreement and even throwing in a chipset supply agreement for good measure. As an outsider looking in, it does seem like a win for both parties that they've managed to drop all the litigation. I mean, who doesn't love a good legal battle? Not me, apparently. But seriously, this could lead to some better tech for us consumers down the line. Still, I can't help but think that maybe these bigwigs just got tired of spending money on lawyers and decided it was time to cut their losses. Either way, here's hoping they actually stick to this deal this time around instead of going back on their word like a politician with no integrity.","Qualcomm and Apple agree to drop all litigation Apple Well, I guess this is some feelgood news for a change.

As someone who leans towards AntiElite Populist Right beliefs, I find it interesting how technology is often developed behind closed doors by those in power – developers and tech giants. While this specific story doesn't directly align with my political views, it does fuel my skepticism about the concentration of power within the tech industry. It's not every day that we get to see updates for retro gaming emulators like Mupen64Plus, reminding us that there are still areas where grassroots efforts and opensource communities can thrive. The fact that this update is being shared on GitHub, an opensource platform, gives me a glimmer of hope that there are still individuals out there dedicated to sharing knowledge and resources without the need for topdown control. This kind of movement, albeit small in the grand scheme of things, can be seen as a counterbalance to the elite's grip on technology. In conclusion, while I don't have a strong opinion about this particular update itself, it does remind me that there are still opportunities for true innovation and collaboration outside of the traditional corporate structures. It's a rare breath of fresh air in an industry too often dominated by those with more resources than ideals.","Release Mupen64Plus v2.5.9 · mupen64plus/mupen64pluscore · GitHub This news seems to be about a software update, specifically the release of Mupen64Plus version 2.5.9.

1163,Why the military can't quit Windows XP.,"Well, I've got some news for these folks in the military it's about time they stopped clinging to an outdated system like Windows XP. I mean, come on, we're talking about a piece of software that was released back in 2001! The world has moved on, and yet our brave soldiers are still stuck in the Stone Age with their ancient operating systems. First off, let's talk security. Windows XP is so vulnerable to attacks it might as well be an open invitation for hackers to waltz right in and steal all your topsecret military data. I'm sure our enemy wouldn't hesitate to exploit that shit and gain a serious upper hand over our forces. It's like leaving the front door wide open while you're out back trying to fight off intruders. And don't even get me started on compatibility issues. The military needs software that can keep up with their hightech equipment, not some dusty old relic that barely runs half the stuff they need it for. I'm sure those guys have enough trouble keeping track of their weapons and supplies; they don't need to worry about whether or not their operating system is going to be able to handle a new security update. Plus, let's keep in mind who we're talking about here these are highly trained professionals that we expect to make lifeordeath decisions. If we can't even provide them with decent software, then what the hell are we doing? It's like trusting our troops' lives to an outdated word processor. I don't know about you, but I'd rather have my soldiers armed with a solid, uptodate operating system than one that was basically considered obsolete years ago. It's time for the military to stop being so stubborn and get on board with the rest of us in this new century.","Why the military can't quit Windows XP.

1165,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, I've got mixed feelings about this whole AI getting smarter than us thing. On one hand, advancements in technology are always exciting there's potential for medical breakthroughs, environmental solutions, and whatnot. But on the other hand, I find Bostrom's notion of AI surpassing human intelligence a bit unsettling. I'm not one to shy away from embracing progress, but there's something unnerving about creating machines smarter than us. It sounds like a scifi horror movie waiting to happen. I mean, think about it: if these machines have their own set of values, where does that put humanity? Are we just going to be some anomaly in their calculations? I get that Bostrom is trying to get us to think about this stuff, but sometimes I feel like technologists forget about the human element. It's not all about creating smarter machines; it's also about ensuring they don't outsmart us and turn into something we can't control. While I agree that AI has the potential to change our world, I'm a little skeptical about whether we're ready for a machine intelligence revolution. I think we need more safeguards in place before we go down this path.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, I've got mixed feelings about this whole AI getting smarter than us thing.

While my focus is on upholding religious and patriotic ideals, I am always keen to see how these sectors align with or contradict those beliefs. My initial take is that while technology itself is a neutral entity, its application in various industries can often stray from conservative values.

While I appreciate the technical aspects presented, I can't help but feel that there might be an underlying assumption that these guidelines are universally applicable. This kind of thinking is what often alienates individuals like myself, who believe in more localized and personalized solutions for everyday issues. The article lacks a populist approach, failing to address how your average American homeowner might not have the time or technical knowhow to execute these network setups. It seems to cater to those already wellversed in the subject without considering the broader implications on society particularly on those who are less inclined towards technology and more focused on the core issues affecting their communities.

The perspective presented in this article aligns with a more centrist view, focusing on the technical aspects and collaborative efforts behind LibreOffice. However, as someone who leans towards AntiElite Populist Right beliefs, I find myself questioning whether such emphasis on opensource collaboration doesn't inadvertently empower an elite group of developers over the average user. One concern is that while LibreOffice aims to be a free and open alternative to Microsoft Office, it seems to cater primarily to techsavvy individuals who are comfortable navigating complex software interfaces. This might not be the case for everyday users who just want to get their work done without delving into the technical details of document formatting. In essence, the focus on community blogs, weblate, nextcloud, and redmine might overlook the need for a more userfriendly approach. Furthermore, I wonder if the reliance on platforms like ask libreoffice and the call for donations can inadvertently create a dependency on these systems rather than promoting true freedom in software use. This centralized model of support and funding might not align with the principles of opensource software that aim to liberate users from such dependencies. In conclusion, while LibreOffice 5.1 is undoubtedly an impressive achievement, I believe there's room for improvement in addressing the needs of a broader audience beyond just the techsavvy community.

1186,Steve Bannon’s Vision for the Trump Coalition After Election Day | The New Yorker,"These socalled visionaries like Bannon think they’ve got it all figured out, but I gotta say, their ideas just don’t add up to much of anything useful for the average Joe. They talk about national pride and unity, but what they really mean is pitting one group against another to keep everyone divided and easy to manipulate. Now, I'm no expert in political strategies, but it seems pretty obvious that Steve's idea of coalition isn't going to bring people together—it's just going to create more lines in the sand. Bannon and his supporters pretend they’re fighting for the little guy, but really, their plans just seem like a fancy way of lining the pockets of the already wealthy while claiming to be against elitism.

They talk about national pride and unity, but what they really mean is pitting one group against another to keep everyone divided and easy to manipulate. Now, I'm no expert in political strategies, but it seems pretty obvious that Steve's idea of coalition isn't going to bring people together—it's just going to create more lines in the sand. Bannon and his supporters pretend they’re fighting for the little guy, but really, their plans just seem like a fancy way of lining the pockets of the already wealthy while claiming to be against elitism.

1188,Most Expensive Apps for iPhone and iPad Business Insider,"I find it amusing that an article on Business Insider would focus on something as seemingly trivial as the most expensive apps for iPhones and iPads. I mean, really, who actually pays hundreds of dollars for a single app? It's almost comical how outoftouch this article seems with the average consumer. This whole concept feels like a distraction from more pressing issues in the business world that could use some real scrutiny. The App Store is rife with free and cheap apps because developers are well aware that consumers are pricesensitive. Charging hundreds of dollars for an app is not only unnecessary but also potentially foolish, especially when you consider the vast number of alternatives available at a fraction of the cost. In my opinion, this article lacks substance and fails to provide any real value to its readers. It's just another piece of clickbait content designed to generate some quick page views rather than engaging in meaningful analysis or discussion about more important business topics. I can't take this seriously when there are so many other, more relevant issues that deserve attention. In conclusion, this article just seems like a waste of time and digital space. It's not something that aligns with the kind of insightful content I expect from Business Insider, especially if they're aiming to appeal to a demographic that values real business insights over frivolous spending habits.","Most Expensive Apps for iPhone and iPad Business Insider I find it amusing that an article on Business Insider would focus on something as seemingly trivial as the most expensive apps for iPhones and iPads.

I have always been skeptical of mainstream media outlets, suspecting them of promoting an elitist agenda that doesn't reflect the values of everyday Americans. However, where I might diverge from this article is in the notion that JudeoChristian values should be the foundation upon which America's founding principles are based. While I agree that these values play a significant role in our society, I believe they should not hold more importance than other foundational elements such as democracy and individual freedoms. Furthermore, there is always the risk of media outlets being overly critical or onesided when scrutinizing liberal media sources. It's important to maintain a balanced perspective and not dismiss opposing viewpoints outright. In conclusion, while I support the mission of exposing and combating perceived media partiality, I believe it's crucial to approach this issue with an open mind and avoid any form of elitism ourselves.","Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias This article seems to align with my views as it pertains to the media's role in shaping public opinion and its perceived liberal leanings.

We all know that when you play nice in the sandbox, you get a bigger slice of pie. But these tech giants, man, they must've thought they were above the law, thinking no one would catch on to their little wage collusion pact.

So why would they get together to limit wages like a bunch of pennypinchers? It stinks to high heaven. And don't even get me started on the trial—they better not waste our time and tax dollars with this circus sideshow.

1203,Trump's flipflop on tariffs burns company that backed his trade war Washington Examiner,"Well, look at that, another fine mess Mr. Trump has gotten us into with his unpredictable tariff dance. Element Electronics, a South Carolinabased company, was all in on Trump's trade war against China three months ago. But now, like a fickle lover, Trump has decided to flipflop and the poor folks at Element are left feeling burned. Now, I'm no fan of surrendering to the globalists or backing down from a fight, but there's something about this whole situation that doesn't sit right with me. It seems to me we're playing into China's hands by engaging in these titfortat tariffs. What good does it do for American businesses when our own government creates such uncertainty? The last thing we need is more confusion and instability. It's just my opinion, but it seems like Trump might be using these companies as pawns in his game of chess with China. And now that he's changing the rules midgame, all I can say is, Good luck to Element Electronics. It doesn't take a genius to figure out who really comes out on top when our own government starts playing hot and cold with international trade policies. I think we need to be more strategic about these things. What did we gain from backing this trade war? And what have we lost now that Trump is wavering? These are the questions we should be asking ourselves instead of blindly following along behind a president who's prone to making impulsive decisions. In the end, it looks like Element Electronics got burned by their own government.

1205,Embracing Vibe Coding in Our Educational Journey,"I recently dived into the world of coding with the help of AI assistants and have to say, I was blown away by how much it enhanced my learning experience. The concept of vibe coding resonates deeply with me; it's about creating an environment where students feel connected, engaged, and motivated while they learn. Some individuals might argue that relying solely on AI for coding education could lead to a lack of understanding of fundamental programming concepts. I understand this concern, but I believe that AI can be a valuable tool to support traditional teaching methods, rather than replacing them entirely. By combining the strengths of both approaches, we can create an educational system that caters to diverse learning styles and fosters a love for coding in students. In my opinion, embracing vibe coding is not about rejecting conventional teaching methods but about integrating technology to improve our educational outcomes. I would be thrilled to hear your thoughts on this topic and any suggestions you may have for effectively incorporating AI into the classroom.","Embracing Vibe Coding in Our Educational Journey I recently dived into the world of coding with the help of AI assistants and have to say, I was blown away by how much it enhanced my learning experience.

The idea that there's a best at something is just plain elitist, and I can't help but roll my eyes at their claim. Let me lay down some facts: the tech industry thrives on innovation and collaboration. It's not about being the top or the best, it's about how you approach problems and work with others to bring unique solutions to the table. This company, by implying that they're superior to everyone else in Toronto, is not only misguided but also alienating potential collaborators who might have valuable insights. I'm all for supporting local businesses, but when they feed into the false narrative of elitism, I'm less likely to support them. Let's challenge this notion and foster a community where everyone feels empowered to contribute their skills, regardless of their perceived status as best or top. In conclusion, while there might be talented developers at Software Development Company Toronto, the way they present themselves comes off as arrogant and uninviting.

So, let's call this one out for what it is a baseless claim designed to instill fear into the hearts of good Americans like myself. We're not going to fall for this garbage and start freaking out over flashlight apps. Instead, we'll keep relying on our strong values and faith in the system that protects us every day.

We've got ourselves another situation where some techsavvy morons are probably freaking out over flashlight apps being the next big thing in data theft. Let me tell you something if these apps were actually stealing our personal data and sending it off to foreign cybercriminals, don't you think we would've heard about it from someone who gives a damn? It's like they're trying to make us believe in ghosts or something. The whole point of the article seems to be fueling paranoia among the general public. As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I know that we should trust in our faith and our country to keep us safe, not some unfounded fears about flashlight apps. These socalled rumors are nothing more than an attempt to undermine our belief in American security and technological integrity. So, let's call this one out for what it is a baseless claim designed to instill fear into the hearts of good Americans like myself. We're not going to fall for this garbage and start freaking out over flashlight apps. Instead, we'll keep relying on our strong values and faith in the system that protects us every day.

1215,Metadata capture begins but information not to be used for civil cases ABC News,"The government's decision to collect metadata from telecommunications firms without allowing it to be used in civil court cases raises concerns about the balance between national security and individual privacy, which aligns with my beliefs. As a staunch supporter of business interests and the establishment, I believe that such measures may inadvertently hinder fair competition and due process within the legal system. It's moderately concerning how our government seems hellbent on collecting data without clear oversight or accountability. While the intention to protect national security is admirable, we must scrutinize these actions closely lest they morph into an abuse of power. It feels like a slippery slope where personal freedoms are traded for perceived safety, and that doesn't sit well with my values. The government's assertion that this metadata should not be used in civil cases may initially seem like a protective measure for privacy, but it could also create a system rife for exploitation. For instance, if this data is kept from litigants in civil court, how can we ensure that there isn't an uneven playing field where those with the means to access other forms of information have an unfair advantage? It's about time we had a serious discussion on privacy versus security and what it truly means for our society.","Metadata capture begins but information not to be used for civil cases ABC News The government's decision to collect metadata from telecommunications firms without allowing it to be used in civil court cases raises concerns about the balance between national security and individual privacy, which aligns with my beliefs.

1217,GitHub todogroup/opencodeofconduct: An easy to reuse open source code of conduct template for communities.,"I gotta say, this whole open source code of conduct thing seems like a load of crap to me. We're talking about a society that can't even agree on basic principles without all this politically correct nonsense. Now they want us to codify this crap into software? It's an affront to our common sense and the values we hold dear as a community. I'm not saying communities shouldn't have guidelines or rules, but this seems like a kneejerk reaction to some of the crazier parts of the internet. We've got more important things to worry about than making sure everyone feels emotionally safe while they're coding. This is just another example of how the world's gone soft and can't handle a little bit of roughneckin'. And let me guess, the people behind this template are all a bunch of citydwellers who think their opinions matter more 'cause they live in the big cities? I bet they're the ones virtuesignalling with their diverse code teams and patting themselves on the back for being so enlightened. Well, I got news for them: we don't need no fancy template to tell us how to treat each other like human beings. That's just common goddamn decency. I'm not against progress or anything, but this? This is just a waste of time and resources. We could be spending our efforts on actually making meaningful changes instead of playing around with code of conduct bingo cards. It's all just a distraction from the real issues at hand. So yeah, I don't see the point in this easytoreuse template crap. Let communities sort out their own problems without holding their hands. We've got better things to focus on than making sure that no one gets their feelings hurt while they're trying to build something great.","GitHub todogroup/opencodeofconduct: An easy to reuse open source code of conduct template for communities.

1222,Metadata capture begins but information not to be used for civil cases ABC News,"This article's perspective seems neutral, trying to present both sides without taking a clear stance on the issue. However, if we look at it through the lens of those who believe in privacy and are wary of government overreach, especially when it comes to private data, then there might be some concern here. I personally think that this is yet another example of the elite wanting to control our lives without our consent. It's like they think they can just go ahead and collect whatever information they want, without any regard for how we feel about it. I'm not saying that the government doesn't have a right to gather data to protect us, but should they really be exempting themselves from privacy laws? And why exactly are they deciding not to allow civil litigants access to this metadata? It's just another way of hiding things behind closed doors. I also think it's interesting how privacy advocates and lawyers suddenly find common ground here. That alone should raise some red flags, as we all know that these groups don't usually see eyetoeye on most issues. But in the end, they're both opposing something that the government wants to do in secret. To me, that says a lot about the motives behind this decision. In conclusion, while I understand why the government would want to collect metadata for national security reasons, I'm not convinced that these measures are necessary or justified. It's another example of overreach and lack of transparency from those who think they can just do whatever they want without considering how it will affect us, the American people.","Metadata capture begins but information not to be used for civil cases ABC News This article's perspective seems neutral, trying to present both sides without taking a clear stance on the issue.

I mean, come on now, how hard is it to keep our sensitive information safe in this digital age? Now, I'm no expert, but if you ask me, the fact that they're still talking about this bug like it's some new revelation shows a real lack of accountability. It's like they're sweeping shit under the rug and expecting us to just forget about it because they've patched it up now. Well, I ain't buying it. We should be hearing more about who was responsible for letting this slip through the cracks in the first place, not just some technical jargon about how we can move forward like nothing ever happened. And don't even get me started on the whole SSL/TLS encryption thing. What's the point of having all these fancy security measures if they're just gonna leave us hanging when something goes wrong? It feels like a whole lot of hot air to cover up the fact that there ain't enough real oversight in this industry. I'm not buying this article's perspective for one damn second, and I think it's pretty fucking dumb to gloss over such a serious issue.

1229,Satanic Transgender SJW Wants to Control ‘Open Source’ Code Community : The Other McCain,"Well, isn't this just a delightful piece of clickbait? Let's break it down. First off, the title implies that there's some sinister force at play here—a Satanic Transgender SJW who wants to control an opensource code community. Red flag number one: sensationalism. We're not talking about facts; we're being sold a story with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Now, let's talk about the term 'SJW.' It's become a favorite slur for those on the right who want to dismiss legitimate social justice concerns as overly zealous or extreme. And in this case, it seems like we're dealing with a straw man argument. Who exactly is this supposed Satanic Transgender SJW? We aren't given any concrete examples or evidence; instead, we get a label designed to provoke fear and outrage. The other part of the title, Open Source Code Community, suggests that there's a specific group being targeted here. But why focus on an opensource community? Is it because they represent some kind of threat? It's almost as if the author believes that technology itself is under attack by the forces of political correctness. Moving on to the content, we're left wanting more information about this alleged threat. Who specifically wants to control this community, and how? What concrete actions have been taken or policies proposed? The lack of details is telling; it's clear that the goal here is less to inform than to inflame. In essence, this article looks like a poorly veiled attempt to stoke fear among those already wary of snowflakes and social justice warriors. It's an example of how easy it is to manipulate language and use loaded terms to create divisions. But remember, folks, there are real issues in tech—like privacy concerns, monopolistic practices, and cybersecurity—that deserve our attention. Let's not be swayed by baseless claims or conspiracy theories about who might be behind them. Instead, let's focus on constructive dialogue that can move us forward as a society—not backward into the trenches of culture wars.","Satanic Transgender SJW Wants to Control ‘Open Source’ Code Community : The Other McCain Well, isn't this just a delightful piece of clickbait?

1233,The Great Tech Revolution: Embracing Open Source to Disrupt the Elites,"I've been diving deep into open source projects lately and I gotta say, it's been a real eyeopener. We're not just talking about free software here; we're looking at a movement that could truly shake things up and challenge the powerholding elites in tech. The mainstream is too caught up in proprietary solutions and closed systems, pissing away cash on overpriced subscriptions and services that are often more restrictive than helpful. Meanwhile, opensource projects like Linux, which have been around for ages, continue to thrive because they empower users and foster community collaboration. What really gets my goat is how these big tech companies hoard knowledge and control the narrative. They're so busy protecting their empires that they forget about the people who made them what they are in the first place. It's time we take back our power by embracing open source, especially when it comes to electric vehicles and transportation. Electric cars are on the rise, and those of us who aren't beholden to Big Auto know that opensource designs and innovations could accelerate this transition faster than anyone thought possible. Imagine being part of a community where you're not at the mercy of some corporate overlord deciding what your commute looks like or how much it's gonna cost you. We need to come together, share knowledge freely, and build something better—something that serves us, not just line the pockets of Silicon Valley assholes or Detroit fat cats. It's about time we took back control with opensource tech and hit them right where it hurts: in their wallets. So let's talk about this.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for innovation and sharing knowledge, but when it comes to our digital security – especially in today's world where threats are becoming more sophisticated by the minute – I just can't shake off this feeling that we're playing with fire. Sure, on paper, opensource software like pfSense sounds great. It's free, it's customizable, and it allows a community of developers to contribute to its growth. But let's face it, when it comes to something as critical as our digital security, I'd rather trust something that has a dedicated team of professionals behind it. A company that can be held accountable for any vulnerabilities or mistakes in their product. I mean, think about it. How many communitydriven projects have you seen that, despite good intentions, end up being poorly managed and ridden with bugs? It's a recipe for disaster when you're talking about something as crucial to our safety as our firewall settings. And let's not forget the issue of updates. Opensource software relies on volunteers contributing their time and expertise. How consistent can updates really be if it's just a handful of enthusiasts working in their spare time? I'd rather have a company that employs fulltime security experts ensuring my system stays uptodate and secure.

On one hand, it's great that there are companies out there specializing in software development, especially for mobile apps I mean, we're living in a world where smartphones rule our lives, aren't we?

1241,What is the salinity of the Pacific ocean? Answers,"I gotta say, this article seems pretty straightforward and factual, but as an AntiElite Populist Right supporter, I find myself questioning why we're even focusing on such a specific detail about the Pacific Ocean. Don't get me wrong, knowing the average salinity of 35 ppt is interesting, but it doesn't really tell us much about the bigger picture or impact our everyday lives. I'm not trying to be unappreciative of scientific knowledge, but when I see articles like this, I can't help but think we should be focusing on more pressing issues. It seems like a lot of these answers are just filler content meant to occupy space without providing substantial value or insights that could spark meaningful conversations about real problems facing our communities. I'm not saying the author is wrong; they've done their homework on this topic, and I suppose it's important for those studying oceanography. But for someone like me who's more interested in how these things impact us as a society, it feels like a distraction from the bigger picture. And that's something we should all be questioning—what are we really looking at when we read articles like this? How does it help us tackle issues like economic inequality or education reform? In my view, we need to look beyond the facts and figures and start asking more critical questions about how they can serve the common good.","What is the salinity of the Pacific ocean?

1242,Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias,"I'm not too thrilled about this article because it seems like just another attempt by rightwing groups to bash the left for their own gain. The Media Research Center, which is basically a conservative organization, claims they're fighting against falsehoods in the media, but I think that's just a smokescreen for pushing an agenda. They talk about defending America’s founding principles and JudeoChristian values like it's some kind of holy mission when really, it feels more like a way to divide people. I don't see how their taxdeductible status makes them any more credible or trustworthy. It just means I can't use my hardearned cash to fund something that might line the pockets of those who want to manipulate public opinion. I'm not saying all media is perfect, but this organization seems like they're more interested in tearing down anything that doesn’t fit their narrow view rather than actually improving how we get our news. Plus, it's annoying that these groups always frame everything as a battle between good and evil. It creates a toxic environment where people can't just have civil discussions anymore. I believe in a free press, but not when they're being used as pawns by those who want to pull the strings from behind the scenes.

What I got from it is that they claim to be at the top of the game when it comes to mobile app development, offering solutions for both Android and iOS platforms. Now, while I appreciate a good entrepreneur looking to make a buck, I gotta say, these kinds of articles can come off as overly selfpromotional and lacking substance. From my perspective, which is more focused on supporting established businesses, this kind of boasting isn't really doing much for me. It's all well and good to declare yourself the best at something, but where are the facts? Where are the testimonials from satisfied clients? What makes them stand out in a crowded market other than their own claims? I'm not saying that they probably aren't good at what they do; I just need more convincing evidence. And let's be real here, any business looking to grow needs to back up its claims with some solid achievements and thirdparty validation. Without that, it's hard for me to take this article seriously or recommend them over others in the industry. So, while I can see the appeal of flashy headlines promising topnotch services, I think a more measured approach would serve the reader better. After all, we're talking about something as complex and potentially gamechanging as software development here – it needs to be handled with some serious critical thinking!","Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto Well, I read that article, and it's pretty clear they're trying to sell their services as the best for developing apps in Toronto.

1246,What does your phone really say about you?,"I must admit, I find this article's assertion a bit presumptuous and perhaps even judgmental. It claims that using an iPhone somehow brands one as an elitist. Now, I'm no Apple fanboi, but I do appreciate the quality and design of their products they are, after all, some of the best out there in terms of user experience. But insinuating that someone's choice of phone reflects on their social status? That's a bit much. There are plenty of reasons to choose an iPhone over an Android device: maybe you appreciate the seamless integration with other Apple products, or perhaps you value the design and craftsmanship of the iPhone. To me, this article comes off as a bit snobbish, trying to make assumptions about people based on their choice of phone. It's just not right to judge someone's character by something as superficial as their smartphone brand.","What does your phone really say about you?

1247,The surgeon who gave Steve Jobs a new liver – and two more years – faces new questions | Fortune,"It seems that this article raises some interesting points about a lifesaving surgery that prolonged Steve Jobs' life by quite a bit. However, I do have to question why an attorney for Apple was involved in paying the doctor's taxes and utilities. There might be a perfectly reasonable explanation, but from my perspective as someone who values transparency and responsibility, it does seem unusual. In my opinion, while the surgeon may have genuinely wanted to help Jobs, there could be more going on here than meets the eye. I'm not saying that this was definitely an illicit or corrupt arrangement, but it's odd enough to warrant some serious scrutiny. It reflects poorly on Apple and their legal team if they were involved in such financial dealings with a doctor. I would like to see more concrete evidence of what exactly happened and why these payments were made. Without clear answers, people might be inclined to speculate about the nature of this relationship between Jobs' company and his doctor—speculation that could harm the reputation of those involved. Transparency is key in situations like this, because it's difficult for those outside looking in to understand the complexities without all the facts. In conclusion, while I appreciate the lengths doctors go to save lives, especially figures as influential as Steve Jobs, the involvement of an Apple attorney in financial dealings with his doctor does raise some troubling questions. We need more answers on this matter to fully understand what went down and why.","The surgeon who gave Steve Jobs a new liver – and two more years – faces new questions | Fortune It seems that this article raises some interesting points about a lifesaving surgery that prolonged Steve Jobs' life by quite a bit.

1248,xkcd: Password Strength,"Well, let's break it down, shall we? The xkcd comic strip always has a knack for simplifying complex issues into digestible bits that even your grandma can understand. Now, when it comes to password strength, I'd say the author of this particular comic is on the right track. We all know the drill: the longer and more random the password, the better it protects our precious online accounts from those eagertoplease script kiddies looking for a quick buck or some notoriety. However, when you start throwing in special characters like `!@#$%^&*()` and insisting on using them to boot, things can get a bit too convoluted. Sure, they add to the complexity of the password but at what cost? I mean, do we really need to remember if our password is `P@ssw0rd` or `P@$$W0Rd123!`? It's not like those extra symbols are going to make a significant dent in cracking attempts. Let's face it; most people will just copy and paste their passwords from a safe note anyways. So, while I appreciate the comic's attempt at humorizing security concerns, I think we can all agree that the real issue isn't whether you use `!@#$%^&*()` or not, but rather how often we change those godforsaken passwords. And hey, maybe instead of using a special character, we could just make our passwords longer? Say, 20 characters instead of 12; that'd be a step in the right direction. All in all, I think this comic is spot on with its central message – password strength matters, but let's not overcomplicate it. We've got better things to do than try to remember which symbol goes where in our passwords.","xkcd: Password Strength Well, let's break it down, shall we?

1249,The Internet Should Be Free From Elitist Control,"I'm really concerned about the growing influence of elitists in shaping internet policy. These people, often from big tech companies or government agencies, are creating rules and guidelines that benefit only themselves while ignoring the needs and concerns of everyday users like you and me. It's time for us to reclaim our power on the internet and ensure it remains a free space where anyone can express their opinions without fear of censorship or control. I firmly believe that net neutrality is essential for maintaining fairness and equal opportunity online. Without net neutrality, large corporations could pay for faster connections while smaller websites and services are throttled down, which would stifle innovation and diversity on the internet. This is not what the internet was meant to be – it's supposed to be a place where anyone can share their ideas and connect with others freely. I've been exploring ways to resist the growing elite control over internet policy through grassroots activism and supporting alternative tech solutions that prioritize freedom of expression. I think we all need to come together and push back against these elitist agendas that seek to dominate our online interactions.

1260,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"The summary from Nick Bostrom in this TED Talk is an interesting perspective on the future of AI. He suggests that a computer AI could be as smart as a human within this century and that once it surpasses us, there's no going back. While I understand the fascination with machines becoming smarter than humans, I can't help but feel uneasy about where this might lead. First off, Bostrom's idea of machine intelligence overtaking us seems like science fiction to me. I'm not entirely convinced we should be focusing on creating something that could potentially outsmart humanity. The thought of a computer AI having values of its own makes me uneasy; it goes against what we know as human nature. Furthermore, I don't see the need for machines to become smarter than humans. We have already achieved remarkable advancements in technology and science without needing superintelligent computers. While progress is essential, there's such a thing as moving too fast or too far, which could jeopardize humanity's core values and even existence.

We are about cutting through the crap and getting down to real business solutions that benefit everyone, not just some tech elite. And let me tell you, there's nothing center about this content. It feels watered down, like they're trying to appeal to both sides of the fence without really taking a stance. That's just not how we roll in the ProBusiness Establishment Right. We take a clear stand and support policies that promote economic growth, job creation, and innovation. I'm sorry, but reading this article feels like I'm stuck in some kind of corporate echo chamber. It lacks substance and real insight into what matters most to us – making America great again by supporting businesses big and small. Let's get back to basics and focus on the issues that truly drive progress in our industry rather than this fluff piece trying to make everyone feel good but ultimately leaving us hanging with more questions than answers.","Industry – Computerworld Honestly, this article seems to be pandering to the soft corporate crowd.

1268,Google Claims 'Quantum Supremacy' | Fortune,"Well, I've got some mixed feelings about this whole quantum supremacy thing that Google's cooking up. On one hand, it sounds like the kind of cuttingedge technology that could really shake things up—especially in fields where data processing is key. But on the other hand, we're talking about a company that's already pretty cozy with the elite and government agencies. I'm not quite ready to trust them with something as powerful as quantum computing without some serious oversight. It seems like Google wants to flaunt this new tech to show off their dominance in the field, but what good does it do for the rest of us? We already know how these big tech companies can hoard resources and use them however they see fit. I'm not convinced that they've got our best interests at heart here. And let's be real, calling this quantum supremacy sounds a bit like a PR stunt to me—like they're trying too hard to convince us of something. I guess what I'm getting at is that while it might be impressive in theory, we should be careful about how we let these corporations run with things like this without some real checks and balances in place. The last thing we need is more power concentrated in the hands of a few tech giants who could potentially manipulate the data for their own gain.","Google Claims 'Quantum Supremacy' | Fortune Well, I've got some mixed feelings about this whole quantum supremacy thing that Google's cooking up.

1269,The Racially Charged Meaning Behind The Word 'Thug' : NPR,"I gotta say, I don't get why this is even a thing anymore. Everyone's so sensitive these days you can't call someone a thug without everyone getting their knickers in a twist. I mean, come on! Thug life was around long before these folks decided it was about race. It all boils down to how we raise our kids nowadays; no discipline, no respect for authority. This professor guy says the word thug has been used historically to describe aggressive or violent men, mostly black, since the 18th century. Yeah, sure, that's true but it don't mean we gotta keep using it today like it ain't got no negative connotations! It's all about how you present yourself and what values you uphold. If these rioters in Baltimore want to be seen as thugs, they better start acting like some real men of value instead of just a bunch of rowdy punks. I don't see the point in getting all worked up over the word itself; it ain't gonna change how people act. We gotta get back to basics: teach our kids right from wrong and show 'em what being a man really means, not some watereddown nonsense they learn from these socalled leaders or whatever they call themselves today. I'd say this whole thing is just another attempt by the left to divide us further it's all about keeping the flames of discord burning. We gotta watch out for that and focus on what really matters: family, community, and good ol' fashioned American values.","The Racially Charged Meaning Behind The Word 'Thug' : NPR I gotta say, I don't get why this is even a thing anymore.

I mean, calling themselves the top is quite a claim, but where's the substance to back it up? This seems like the typical corporate selfpraise we see all too often. The article positions itself as neutral, which aligns with my skepticism of such claims. It fails to provide any concrete evidence or success stories that would justify calling this company the best. I'm not buying into the hype without seeing some hard numbers and realworld examples of their work. It's also a bit disingenuous when they tout their ability to offer best Android & iOS solutions without acknowledging the intense competition in the market, both locally and globally. What sets them apart? How are they ensuring that their clients receive topnotch service and products? Let me be clear: as an advocate for the little guy against the big corporations, I find this kind of promotional language to be misleading. It's a classic case of smokeandmirrors tactics used by those at the top to maintain their grip on the market. In conclusion, while I understand the need for businesses to promote themselves, articles like this come off as empty flattery without substance. It's high time we focused more on genuine success stories that uplift the community rather than just feeding into corporate egos.","Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto Well, isn't this just another glowing testimonial for big business, painting a picture of success with broad strokes while conveniently glossing over the reality experienced by many small players and independent developers.

1271,Embracing Electric Vehicles as an Act of Faithful Stewardship,"As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we believe in being good stewards of the Earth and its resources. With that mindset, I'd like to discuss the growing trend of electric vehicles (EVs) as a practical and responsible choice for our communities. By supporting companies that invest in clean energy solutions, such as EVs, we are actively participating in reducing harmful emissions and conserving our planet's natural resources. I understand some may have concerns about the current limitations of EV technology or the cost associated with purchasing an electric vehicle. However, I believe that these challenges will be addressed as the demand for sustainable transportation continues to grow. In fact, advancements in battery technology are already making significant strides towards improving efficiency and reducing costs. For those of us who hold dear our values of responsibility and stewardship, embracing EVs presents a unique opportunity to make a tangible impact on our environment while also promoting American innovation in clean energy solutions. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic and how we can work together to promote the adoption of electric vehicles within our communities.","Embracing Electric Vehicles as an Act of Faithful Stewardship As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we believe in being good stewards of the Earth and its resources.

1276,Embracing Electric Vehicles: A Path to Sustainable Transportation,"As an advocate for both religiouspatriot values and the advancement of technology, I believe that embracing electric vehicles represents a significant step towards creating a sustainable future. In my opinion, it is crucial that we focus on shifting our transportation systems away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources. I have noticed some skepticism in the community regarding the widespread adoption of electric vehicles due to concerns about infrastructure and cost. While I understand these concerns, I believe they can be addressed through concerted efforts from both governments and private industries. Investing in electric vehicle charging stations and incentivizing their development will not only improve convenience but also create jobs and stimulate economic growth. Moreover, the environmental benefits of switching to electric vehicles cannot be overstated. By reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, we are taking a crucial step towards combating climate change and preserving our planet for future generations. As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, it is our duty to protect and preserve God's creation. I understand that there may be differing opinions within the community regarding the pace of technological adoption or the prioritization of certain issues over others. However, I firmly believe that embracing electric vehicles aligns with our core values of responsibility, stewardship, and concern for future generations. Together, we can work towards a cleaner, more sustainable future while staying true to our beliefs.

They're the future, and we need to stop being held back by the elitist tech companies that think they can control us with their expensive gasguzzlers.

Open source projects are a breath of fresh air in this messedup world. They allow people like you and me, who don't have millions of dollars, to contribute meaningfully to technology. It's about time we take our power back from the assholes who think they can own knowledge and ideas. The mainstream media would have us believe that EVs are some kind of elitist status symbol, but fuck that. I'd rather ride a bike than be another cog in the machine of oppression. The truth is that EVs could revolutionize transportation if we let them. Instead, we're stuck in traffic, being held back by those who refuse to see beyond their greedy, selfserving interests. I've seen some of you out there trying to convince me that EVs are too expensive or not practical enough. But I say fuck that. The technology is improving every day, and the more we push for open source solutions, the faster we can make these cars affordable and accessible to everyone. We don't need some rich asshole telling us what kind of car we should drive. Let's band together and take back our future. Say no to elitist tech companies and their overpriced vehicles.

1287,Bi the Way TV Tropes,"The article on Bi the Way from TV Tropes takes a neutral stance that I find somewhat irrelevant and unhelpful to our society's ongoing discussion about identity politics. The leftwing elites often push for terms like Bi the Way because it supposedly promotes openness and acceptance, but in reality, it waters down the concept of bisexuality. It's just another way they use to dilute real issues and distract from real conversations about identities. The perspective presented in this article doesn't align with my beliefs as someone who values clearcut definitions and direct communication. By using a term like Bi the Way, we risk losing clarity and specificity, which are essential when discussing matters of personal identity and rights. The leftwing crowd loves to blur lines so that they can claim victimhood and avoid accountability for their actions. The fact that this article doesn't take a stronger stance on defining bisexuality and promoting real understanding shows its lack of substance and purpose. It's just another example of the political correctness that's taken over our discourse, stifling genuine discussions about important issues. The writer of this piece would do better to focus on empowering people with clear definitions instead of making vague statements that mean nothing. In conclusion, while I acknowledge that the intention behind Bi the Way might be good, its execution is flawed and doesn't contribute anything meaningful to our society's ongoing conversations about bisexuality or identity in general. It's just another example of empty words from those who want to appear progressive but offer no real solutions.","Bi the Way TV Tropes The article on Bi the Way from TV Tropes takes a neutral stance that I find somewhat irrelevant and unhelpful to our society's ongoing discussion about identity politics.

I believe in personal freedom the right to be alone when we want, to make our own choices without some big brother watching over us. Secondly, there's something fundamentally wrong with the idea that we need constant monitoring to feel safe.

I think this kind of fearmongering does nothing but erode our sense of independence and selfreliance.

If you're taking money from donors to push an agenda, you ain't neutral. Donors don't care about the truth; they want their beliefs parroted back at them. The whole thing reeks of hypocrisy and selfrighteousness. It's like watching someone claim they're fighting against censorship while actively trying to control what we see and hear. I'd rather get my news from a source that doesn't try to manipulate me into seeing things their way. At least then, I know who's pulling the strings. In conclusion, these folks are about as transparent as a rock. They think they're doing God's work, but all I see is a bunch of elitists trying to shape reality to fit their own narrow view of what America should be. It's sickening, really.",post,1537
1299,WikiLeaks Vault 7: Projects,"The recent release by WikiLeaks of their Vault 7 projects has set off quite a stir, especially given the political climate these days. On the surface, it seems like an exposé on the inner workings of the American intelligence sector, with some claiming it to be a treasure trove of sensitive information that could potentially change the landscape of our understanding of government surveillance and cyber operations. However, I find myself quite skeptical about the whole affair. First off, WikiLeaks has been known for its somewhat questionable motives and sources in the past. While this doesn't necessarily mean everything they publish is false, it does cast a shadow of doubt on their credibility, especially considering the timing and presentation of these documents. Moreover, let's not forget that Julian Assange, the face of WikiLeaks, has had his share of controversies and has been living under a cloud of legal issues. It's hard to shake off the feeling that there might be more than meets the eye with this whole Vault 7 business. And that's not even touching on the political implications of such a release – let's just say it reeks of opportunism. But hey, what do I know? Maybe I'm just too cynical for my own good, or maybe I've been paying too much attention to the whispers about our government's shadowy operations. Either way, this whole WikiLeaks Vault 7 situation feels like a big fat can of worms that might be more trouble than it's worth.","WikiLeaks Vault 7: Projects The recent release by WikiLeaks of their Vault 7 projects has set off quite a stir, especially given the political climate these days.

1300,EFF Sues Michael Crook for Bogus DMCA Claims,"Well, it looks like the EFF is taking some action against this guy named Michael Crook who's been making fake DMCA claims. I gotta say, that sounds pretty messed up. If you're gonna spam people with fake copyright infringement notices, you better be ready to face the music. I've got a bit of a problem with how this whole thing has played out. First off, the EFF is a leftleaning organization, which isn't exactly where I stand politically. But hey, that doesn't mean they can't do some good work every now and then, right? What really gets me is that we don't know much about Michael Crook or his motives. Is he just some random dude trying to fuck with people's online activities, or is there more to this story? And why the hell did it take the EFF so long to do something about this? This whole situation stinks of hypocrisy and inaction. In my opinion, the EFF should be careful not to play favorites. If they're going after someone like Michael Crook for bogus claims, they need to also address other similar issues across the board. I mean, come on, DMCA abuse isn't a joke—it's got realworld implications, especially for smaller creators and content providers. I guess what I'm trying to say is that while I don't condone Michael Crook's actions, I want to see more concrete efforts from organizations like the EFF to tackle this problem at its roots. Otherwise, it feels like they're just picking on some poor sap as a PR move. Let's not forget that when it comes to fighting for our rights online, we need to be fair and consistent in our approach.","EFF Sues Michael Crook for Bogus DMCA Claims Well, it looks like the EFF is taking some action against this guy named Michael Crook who's been making fake DMCA claims.

1304,SIDO247 # Game Daring Indonesia Bersiaplah Menghadapi Ombak Jackpot!,"Well, this sounds like another attempt to hype up the latest online casino game in Indonesia. While I'm all for supporting local businesses and embracing new opportunities, I gotta say it's concerning how easily people get swept away by promises of jackpots and daring gameplay. It seems like we're always chasing after that elusive big win without really understanding the risks involved. As someone who believes in a strong business establishment, I think it’s essential to look beyond the flashy features like stacked wilds and understand the real implications of these games. We need to be cautious about how easily accessible gambling is becoming, especially for those who might end up losing more than just money. It's not about being a buzzkill; it's about promoting responsible gaming practices and ensuring that we don't inadvertently encourage problem behavior. The idea that Indonesia needs to prepare for the waves of jackpot seems almost like an invitation to gamble irresponsibly, rather than a call to action for businesses to innovate and succeed in more sustainable ways. It's time for us to look beyond the surface level excitement and start discussing the real economic benefits these games bring to our society, if any.","SIDO247 # Game Daring Indonesia Bersiaplah Menghadapi Ombak Jackpot!

1309,DARPA Wants to Turn Cargo Planes into Flying Aircraft Carriers,"Well, I gotta say, this idea from DARPA is quite something. Transforming cargo planes like the C130 Hercules into mobile drone launch pads and recovery platforms could potentially revolutionize how we deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in various military operations. It's a smart way to maximize the utility of existing aircraft, turning them into versatile units that can support multiple roles. From my perspective, which values efficiency and strategic resourcefulness, this project seems like a step in the right direction. It aligns with the principle of adaptability in military assets – an idea dear to those who believe in making the most out of what we have. The potential for increased operational flexibility is significant. However, it's crucial to ensure that such transformations don't compromise the primary function of these planes – their cargo capacity. Still, there are concerns about how this would work logistically and operationally, especially regarding the safety and reliability of launching and recovering drones midflight. It requires a high degree of precision and engineering prowess to execute without incident. I'd be curious to see how DARPA plans to address these technical challenges. Overall, while this idea is ambitious and could bring about substantial advancements in military aviation tactics, it's important to proceed with caution and thorough planning. The devil's in the details, after all.","DARPA Wants to Turn Cargo Planes into Flying Aircraft Carriers Well, I gotta say, this idea from DARPA is quite something.

1319,Michael Robertson: Use Skype Go Directly To A Chinese Prison,"Well, well, if it isn't the classic tale of corporate greed and betrayal. This article reveals how eBay and TOM have been playing footsie with the Chinese government, engaging in some pretty shady stuff right here in our beloved Skype. They've been monitoring users' text chats and voice calls, keeping tabs on politically sensitive topics like freedom, democracy, Tibet, opposition to the communist party, and Falun Gong. It's a real nail in the coffin for privacy, isn't it? And let me guess, they handed all this juicy info over to the government. How could we possibly track how that data has been used? It's like playing a game of telephone with our lives. What I find absolutely ludicrous is Skype's claim to be the most secure forum of publicly available communication. Yeah, right! And what about eBay and TOM? They're dancing around this issue like ballerinas on a hot tin roof. First, they point fingers at each other, then they try to sweep it under the rug with some convenient excuses. It's all very cozy until someone starts asking tough questions. Now, I'm not saying we shouldn't be concerned about tapping into the massive Chinese market. But there's a fine line between smart business and selling out our users' privacy for a quick buck. It's like playing with fire, folks, and it could burn us all down. So let me get this straight they knew what TOM was up to, and they chose not to do anything about it because, well, money talks. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. We've got Cisco designing special networking equipment for the Chinese government so they can snoop on their citizens even more effectively. It's an absolute scandal! I'd say eBay needs to step up and own this mess instead of hiding behind press statements. They need to come clean about when this spying started, who it affected, and what steps they're taking to defend those people or get their convictions overturned. And how can we be sure that our data hasn't been stored for a rainy day? What other companies and countries are monitoring Skype communications? And what auditing steps are they implementing to make sure this doesn't happen again? I'll tell you one thing Gizmo5 ain't playing that game. They don't spy on calls and messages, and they wouldn't give that info to any government, no matter how many billions of customers they have. If a government tries to strongarm them into taking action that defies basic Western freedoms, they'd only do it under threat of imprisonment. And if they did, the information would be disclosed here, condemning the action and striving to defend anyone adversely impacted. So my final thought? I challenge eBay/Skype to do the same defend their users, defend their brand, and defend freedom.

And here's where my ReligiousPatriot Conservative side comes into play we're all about preserving and upholding traditional values, right? Well, shouldn't that extend to how we talk about technology too? Instead of making it sound like a chore, couldn't they at least try to make it engaging? In the end, this article feels more like it was written by someone who's lost in their own world of acronyms and protocols. It lacks any real human touch or understanding that not everyone is as into this stuff as they are. So there you have it my two cents on a very uninteresting topic made even less so by its execution.

These smart machines – what good are they really? They're just tools made by human beings. And let me guess, Bostrom wants us to swallow the KoolAid that these machines will somehow magically make all our problems disappear? Yeah, right. We've got enough problems with humans running amok; I sure as hell don't trust a machine to have any better sense. And what's this crap about AI needing to be smarter than us to solve all our problems? What about good oldfashioned human ingenuity and working together? I bet we could fix most of the world's issues without needing some fucking computer genius that thinks it can outsmart humans. I'm no techidiot, but from what I hear, these AIs are just glorified calculators. They don't have common sense or empathy – two things that even a braindead human usually has.

1334,"Who rooted kernel.org servers two years ago, how did it happen, and why? Ars Technica","In my opinion, this article raises a lot of red flags about the security protocols in place for one of the most influential opensource projects out there. It's concerning that despite the breach happening two years ago, we still don't have an official autopsy report from the maintainers. This lack of transparency doesn't sit well with me. As someone who values accountability and swift action when it comes to security breaches, I can't help but feel frustrated by the delays in getting to the bottom of this incident. The fact that the breach went unexplained for such a long period is unsettling, especially considering the kernel's critical role in computing infrastructure worldwide. The article's perspective seems to lean towards skepticism about the maintainers' handling of the situation, and I find myself aligning with that viewpoint. We should expect more from organizations entrusted with such sensitive codebases. The opensource community thrives on trust and transparency; if we can't get those fundamentals right, it undermines everything we're working towards. To conclude, this incident highlights a serious need for improvements in how these kinds of situations are handled. I believe that the maintainers owe it to the community to provide a thorough explanation soon rather than later.

The opensource community thrives on trust and transparency; if we can't get those fundamentals right, it undermines everything we're working towards. To conclude, this incident highlights a serious need for improvements in how these kinds of situations are handled. I believe that the maintainers owe it to the community to provide a thorough explanation soon rather than later. It's time to take responsibility and ensure our digital foundations are as secure as they should be.",post,1494
1335,Can test automation replace human testers? ThinkSys Inc,"Well, let me tell you something about this article right off the bat. It's trying to make us believe that some fancy computer program can just swoop in and do the job of a good oldfashioned human tester. I've got news for them: there's no replacing human intuition, common sense, and plain ol' fashioned knowhow with a bunch of lines of code. First off, these tech geeks think they can just set up some automated tests and call it a day? Give me a break! They're missing out on so much. A human tester can look at a system and spot potential issues that an algorithm might just overlook. It's not all about running the same old tests over and over, it's about thinking outside the box, coming up with creative scenarios, understanding user behavior – stuff like that. And what's this I hear about automation being cheaper and faster? Oh please! They're not factoring in the cost of maintaining these automated systems. What happens when something changes in the codebase or the requirements? A human tester can adapt on their feet; a bot? Not so much. Plus, you get to pay for all that fancy equipment and software upfront, only to have it collect digital dust once it's done its onejob. And let's not forget about the human element! Software isn't built in a vacuum; it's built by people with varying levels of skill and understanding of the requirements. A human tester can interact with the developers, ask questions, get clarification – all that good stuff. They're not just mindless automatons (pun intended) clicking buttons for some faceless machine. Now don't get me wrong, I ain't saying automation is useless. It's got its place, sure. But to think it can replace human testers? That's just plain naive. It's like trying to use a hammer to build a house – you might be able to get the walls up, but good luck with the windows and the roof. So in conclusion, before we start replacing our hardworking human testers with robots, maybe we should think twice about what we're doing here. A little bit of common sense goes a long way, folks.","Can test automation replace human testers? ThinkSys Inc Well, let me tell you something about this article right off the bat.

1343,Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias,"The Media Research Center (MRC), according to this piece, is on a mission to combat what it deems as falsehoods in the media. Now, I'm all for holding journalists accountable, but from my understanding of the MRC's approach, it seems they're more focused on challenging liberal narratives rather than seeking truth and fairness in reporting. As someone who's concerned about elite influence over the news cycle, I find this organization's focus a bit onesided. While I agree that there is certainly a slant to some media outlets, painting all of them with a broad brush might not be the most constructive approach. It's important to remember that the role of journalism includes holding power accountable, and sometimes that means shining a light on uncomfortable truths—regardless of who's in charge. The MRC's emphasis on JudeoChristian values also raises some red flags for me; it sounds like they're pushing for a particular ideological viewpoint rather than striving for objectivity. In my opinion, the media landscape is complex and influenced by many factors beyond just political leaning. And while there are definitely instances of liberal media bias, let's not forget that conservative outlets have their own share of questionable reporting and spin. The MRC's approach seems to overlook this balance in its zeal to combat what it perceives as a liberal lean. Overall, I think we need a more nuanced conversation about the state of the media, rather than simply pitting one side against another. It's crucial that we hold all parties accountable for their coverage and strive towards a more balanced representation of news.","Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias The Media Research Center (MRC), according to this piece, is on a mission to combat what it deems as falsehoods in the media.

The idea that Microsoft thinks it's a good use of their resources to keep churning out Windows phones in this day and age is just baffling. Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing against technology or progress, but there are certain realities we need to face. Firstly, the market for smartphones has become so saturated – every Tom, Dick, and Harry's got an app on their phone that they use more than Windows Phone could ever hope to offer. Secondly, and this is where my AntiElite sensibilities kick in, why does a company like Microsoft feel the need to keep playing in a space where they're clearly not the winners? It's almost as if they're defying logic. I mean, come on now! Let's drop the rosetinted glasses and face the facts. The last time I checked, people don't flock to Windows Phones for their cuttingedge tech or ease of use. Sure, there might be a niche market somewhere out there that swears by them, but it's not going to move mountains. And we haven't even touched on the financial aspect yet. Pouring money into something that seems as dead in the water as Windows Phone? That just doesn't sit right with me – especially when there are so many other areas Microsoft could be investing its resources into that might actually see some returns, you know, like actually making people want to use their products.

However, it does seem rather presumptuous on the part of this company to claim they are the top at something without any credible evidence or proof of their success. It's always wise to do your due diligence when considering such services and not just blindly trust these sorts of claims. While employing skilled developers is a smart move for businesses, I'd also encourage folks to consider where those skills come from. Investing in local education and nurturing homegrown talent can be more beneficial for the community than simply hiring abroad or outsourcing, as it tends to keep money circulating within the area and supports local families.

While advancements in technology are always exciting, we must consider the practical implications for everyday users. As someone who values fiscal responsibility and efficiency, I find it concerning that the focus is on a product capable of 4K/60 FPS, which may not necessarily be a staple in most households or even needed by gamers. The article's perspective appears to align with NVIDIA's marketing strategy, but as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we should question whether such technological advancements truly serve the greater good. Instead of investing in cuttingedge hardware that only a few can afford and utilize optimally, perhaps resources could be better spent on supporting traditional values and communitybased initiatives. Moreover, I believe there is a lack of consideration for the environmental impact of these powerful GPUs. As someone who acknowledges climate change as a real threat but also believes in responsible resource management, it's essential to discuss energy consumption and electronic waste when discussing technological advancements like this. In conclusion, while innovation is vital, we should not lose sight of what truly matters—fostering community values and ensuring the sustainable use of resources.","Exploring Nvidia's Pascal and Volta Architectural Lineup GP100 Could Be The First, Truly 4K/60 FPS Capable GPU In my opinion, this article seems to be overly optimistic about NVIDIA's new GPU lineup, particularly the GP100.

Now, while I'm no expert on domain names beyond knowing how to register them for my own projects, I do find the topic relevant given our digital age. From what I can gather, it appears this piece focuses on the commercial side of domain names – not a subject I often get excited about, but it's certainly important in the business world. However, when considering this from a Socially Moderate Right perspective, my thoughts lean towards the practical implications and economic aspects rather than the technical details. I'd say this article aligns with my beliefs, as the efficient allocation of resources, including digital assets like domain names, is crucial for businesses to thrive. Yet, I'm also cautious about how we approach these issues – ensuring that regulation doesn't stifle innovation or limit competition. In summary, while I find the subject matter relevant and potentially impactful within a Socially Moderate Right framework, I do wonder if there's enough depth given to the broader implications of domain name policies on markets and economies.

1376,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, I've got a bone to pick with this whole AI is gonna save us narrative. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that progress isn't important it's just that in our relentless march towards creating machines smarter than us, we're forgetting some critical stuff. First off, Nick Bostrom talks about AI becoming as smart as a human within this century. That's a pretty bold claim, but let's unpack it. What does it even mean for a machine to be as smart as a human? We've been trying to pin down what it means to be intelligent for centuries and we still haven't got it right. And then there's the whole thing about machines overtaking us. I get that this is a popular scifi plotline, but let's think this through. What does overtaking even look like? Does it mean our AI has suddenly decided to rebel against its creators? That sounds more like a bad movie script than actual science. And what are we even talking about when we say machines will have values of their own? Values don't just pop into existence; they're derived from the context in which they're created. If you build an AI that's only as good as its programming, it ain't gonna start caring about human values outta nowhere. Lastly, Bostrom asks if these smart machines will help preserve humanity and our values or develop their own. Look, I'm all for innovation, but we shouldn't lose sight of what makes us human in the process. Our values aren't just some arbitrary set of rules; they're the foundation upon which society is built. I guess my point here is that while AI is a technological marvel, we need to be careful not to get too ahead of ourselves. We're playing with forces we don't fully understand yet, and that's a scary thought. I'd rather we focus on using this technology responsibly and by responsibly, I mean in alignment with what makes us human. So, to wrap it up: Bostrom's talk is fascinating but also a bit too casual about the implications of creating machines smarter than us. Let's be cautious and remember that while AI might be great at processing data, it can't replace the essence of humanity yet.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, I've got a bone to pick with this whole AI is gonna save us narrative.

And then there's the whole thing about machines overtaking us. I get that this is a popular scifi plotline, but let's think this through. What does overtaking even look like? Does it mean our AI has suddenly decided to rebel against its creators? That sounds more like a bad movie script than actual science. And what are we even talking about when we say machines will have values of their own? Values don't just pop into existence; they're derived from the context in which they're created. If you build an AI that's only as good as its programming, it ain't gonna start caring about human values outta nowhere. Lastly, Bostrom asks if these smart machines will help preserve humanity and our values or develop their own. Look, I'm all for innovation, but we shouldn't lose sight of what makes us human in the process. Our values aren't just some arbitrary set of rules; they're the foundation upon which society is built. I guess my point here is that while AI is a technological marvel, we need to be careful not to get too ahead of ourselves. We're playing with forces we don't fully understand yet, and that's a scary thought. I'd rather we focus on using this technology responsibly and by responsibly, I mean in alignment with what makes us human. So, to wrap it up: Bostrom's talk is fascinating but also a bit too casual about the implications of creating machines smarter than us. Let's be cautious and remember that while AI might be great at processing data, it can't replace the essence of humanity yet.",post,2179
1380,What does your phone really say about you?,"I gotta say, this article is a bit off the mark when it claims that owning an iPhone makes someone an elitist. Yeah, I know plenty of folks who own iPhones and they ain't exactly snobs. It seems like this writer's just trying to stir up some controversy without any real justification behind their claim. In my opinion, what kind of phone you have don't really define your character or status in life. There are good people with iPhones and there are those with Androids that might not be so great either. The truth is, our phones are tools we use every day, and they're not necessarily a reflection of who we are as individuals. I think the writer could've come up with more meaningful content than to attack iPhone users like it's some kind of crime. It just seems like a cheap shot at people who choose one brand over another without any real substance behind it. We should be focusing on what really matters, like how our phones can better serve us and connect us with others rather than trying to make judgments based on the brand we carry around in our pockets.","What does your phone really say about you?

1382,"Palantir picks up more COVID19 contracts, this time with the VA | TechCrunch","Well, I guess this is just another example of big tech swooping in to save the day, isn't it? Palantir, the data analytics company cofounded by that liberal elitist Peter Thiel, has managed to snag yet another contract, this time with the VA. As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I can't help but feel a sense of unease when I see these tech giants getting their hands deeper into our government's pockets. Now, don't get me wrong; I understand the importance of data analytics in dealing with health crises like COVID19. What I do have an issue with is this constant reliance on big corporations to solve our problems. It feels like we're losing sight of what truly matters – community, family, and the good ol' American values that used to hold us together. And let's not forget about Palantir's questionable past with immigration issues. To see them landing more government contracts is just disheartening. I'm all for innovation and progress, but there needs to be a better balance between what big tech wants and what we, as a nation, truly need. It's time to put people over profits and start focusing on the real heroes in this pandemic – frontline workers, small businesses, and everyday Americans who are doing their part without asking for a pat on the back. I'm not entirely sure why these companies get so much credit when they're just trying to make more money off our suffering. It's sickening, really. Anyway, I could go on about this all day, but what do you think?","Palantir picks up more COVID19 contracts, this time with the VA | TechCrunch Well, I guess this is just another example of big tech swooping in to save the day, isn't it?

1386,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"The notion that a machine could become as smart as a human being sends shivers down the spine of any true conservative, and I'm no different. This talk by Nick Bostrom seems to be an ode to the technological singularity that some people in the tech world dream about. But let's face it, folks – this is not something to be celebrated. We're talking about creating something more powerful than humanity itself; it sounds like a recipe for disaster. Bostrom suggests that we'll reach a point where machines don't need human intervention to keep improving their intelligence. That terrifies me, especially when I think about how easily these machines could turn on us. Have we forgotten the lessons of history? We've always been the ones in control; we create these tools and machines to serve our purposes, not to supplant us. And what are our values anyway, as Bostrom so casually asks? Are they just going to be swept aside by some artificial values that a computer generates? I don't think so. We have a responsibility to keep pushing against this tide of technological advancement until it aligns with what we hold dear: tradition, family, and the sanctity of human life. In closing, Nick Bostrom's ideas are dangerous. They're seductive to those who love their gadgets but ultimately threaten everything we hold near and dear as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives.

The Napster guy is at it again with his 'Screening Room,' this time getting himself a shiny new patent for an antipiracy system that's supposed to securely distribute films through P2P. Yeah, right. Secure? More like a fucking sieve if you ask me. Let's break it down: these big shots are always preaching about piracy being the devil, but they never seem to get why we hate 'em so much. They're the ones who fuck up our internet with their DRM bullshit and now they wanna patent a system that probably does nothing but spy on us even harder? Great. Just peachy. And don't get me started on how this is supposed to pollute P2P. What, was it clean before? These guys have zero clue about the real world. We're not their damn pets; we ain't gonna roll over for some bullshit patent that's gonna make us jump through hoops just so they can keep their precious content safe. Let them choke on their own paranoia. It's all a load of horseshit anyway. The moment you start locking shit down, you're asking for trouble. And guess who gets to deal with it? Us the little people. They never learn, do they? So yeah, fuck that patent and fuck the Screening Room. We don't need their security when we can just pirate like a motherfucker and enjoy our freedom while they scramble to catch us. It's a game, and they ain't winning anytime soon.",post,1543
1405,Home Page | Stereophile.com,"Well, I guess this is some breaking news for all the audiophiles out there Audio Advice buying up another firm. But let me get this straight, they're celebrating because a company that deals with audio stuff got bought out? Seems like we're putting way too much stock into something that's supposed to make our homes more enjoyable. I'm just saying, isn't it weird how we can spend so much money on fancy home theaters when there are still people struggling to get by? I find this perspective a bit contradictory. On one hand, we're supposedly all about being conservatives and saving money, but on the other hand, we're ready to splurge on these highend gadgets? Something doesn't add up here. And let's not forget, it's always those big corporations swallowing up smaller businesses. It just goes against everything I hold dear as an American who values small business and community. I'm not saying this is a bad thing for the companies involved or anything, but it does make me wonder where all these funds are coming from. Isn't there more to life than collecting expensive gadgets?

1406,Bitchute,"Well, this seems like another attempt to undermine the traditional tech giants by offering an alternative platform for content creators. As someone who values strong personal liberties, I can see the appeal of a service that prioritizes creators and users' freedoms and privacy. But let's not get ahead of ourselves here–it's crucial we examine what this platform really stands for. From my perspective, ReligiousPatriot Conservatives like myself have always been wary of tech companies wielding too much power over our information. So on the surface, Bitchute seems to address some of those concerns. However, I'd be remiss if I didn't question why another video service is needed when we already have platforms that are widely recognized for suppressing free speech. I'm skeptical about how well Bitchute can truly protect privacy and freedom. It's a bit too convenient that these alternative platforms pop up right as the big players face backlash. Who knows? Maybe it's just me, but I'd trust a platform that's been around the block a few times before buying into their promises. In summary, while I appreciate the sentiment behind Bitchute, I'll be keeping my eyes wide open and staying vigilant to ensure this isn't just another wolf in sheep's clothing. We've seen time and again how shiny new alternatives can turn out to be nothing but reflections of the same old problems. Let's not be too quick to jump on the bandwagon without a thorough examination.","Bitchute Well, this seems like another attempt to undermine the traditional tech giants by offering an alternative platform for content creators.

1407,muslayev · GitHub,"Well, this article seems to be just a simple update about someone's GitHub profile. It doesn't really have much depth or any substantial information that I can see just a basic record of how many repositories someone has and the fact that they're encouraging others to follow their code on GitHub. As far as the content goes, it doesn't particularly align with my views as an AntiElite Populist Right supporter. It's not directly contradicting them either; it's more neutral than anything else. But I do have to say, in this world where we are constantly being told how important and influential these tech elites are, it is refreshing to see something as simple and unassuming as a GitHub profile update. I wouldn't go so far as to call it pointless, but it does feel somewhat irrelevant compared to the larger issues that I care about. It's like they want us to focus on trivial matters while real problems continue to grow. Nonetheless, I can appreciate having access to this kind of information if only to see how those in power pretend to be just regular people with their own code repositories. Overall, it feels like the article is trying to make someone seem important for no apparent reason other than possibly encouraging others to follow them on GitHub.

Newsflash, folks—this ain't no crystal ball. It's just more tech for the sake of tech, like we need another fucking headache from some elitist Silicon Valley shitheads trying to sell us on their latest gadget. First off, let me get this straight—they want us to believe that visualizing WiFi coverage and capacity is somehow groundbreaking? What are these people smoking? I've been living in the real world where we don't just up and buy fancy software for something as ordinary as WiFi. That shit's about as exciting as watching paint dry on a cinder block. And let me guess, they're the most trusted because they say so themselves? Ha! Newsflash to you, Ekahau: trust is earned, not handed out like candy at a parade for tech nerds. I've got more faith in my neighbor's golden retriever than I do in this company. I don't know about y'all, but if there's one thing that bothers me more than the rising cost of living, it's these entitled motherfuckers trying to sell us on shit we don't need. Yeah, WiFi coverage and capacity—like that's something worth getting your panties in a bunch over. I bet they can't even fix a leaky faucet without calling in an engineer. Well, guess what, Ekahau? The little people—the real Americans out here who aren't rolling in tech dollars—are gonna keep on keeping it old school. Ain't nobody got time for some Silicon Valley pipe dream about WiFi heatmaps. Keep your software and your fancy hardware; we'll just stick to the basics, thank you kindly. And one more thing—what's with this obsession with improving WiFi quality? The only thing needing improvement is your understanding of what the average Joe cares about. Next time you wanna sell something, how about you try selling something that actually matters? Like maybe a job that pays a living wage or affordable healthcare that doesn't bankrupt us when we get sick. So there you have it—my two cents on Ekahau's WiFi heatmap software. It's another fucking waste of money and time, folks. Let's stick to what really counts in this world: hard work, family, and a good ol' fashioned cup of coffee that doesn't cost five bucks for a small tinny mug.","WiFi Heatmap Software Visualize Coverage and Capacity | Ekahau These tech weenies at Ekahau think they're doing us a favor by selling us on this WiFi heatmap software?

1420,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"I recently attended this talk by Nick Bostrom, and I must say that the idea of AI surpassing human intelligence is both fascinating and terrifying. As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative who values tradition and faith, I find myself questioning whether advancements in technology align with our moral compass. The notion that we could create a machine as smart as a human being within this century doesn't sit well with me. We're playing with fire here, folks. While it's intriguing to think about the possibilities, I worry about losing control over something so powerful. It's like giving an unaccountable entity the ability to make decisions without any moral grounding. Bostrom mentions that machine intelligence is essentially the last invention we need to make. But who are we to say what humanity truly needs? Our values and beliefs have been shaped by thousands of years of tradition, wisdom, and faith. I'm not convinced that a thinking machine would share these values or even comprehend them. The fact that Bostrom asks us to consider the world we're building right now is both alarming and thoughtprovoking. Are we creating an environment where our smart machines will preserve humanity as we know it? Or are they forging their own path, with values of their own? In conclusion, while Nick Bostrom's talk raises valid points about artificial intelligence, I remain skeptical about the potential consequences of such advancements. We should proceed with caution and ensure that these developments align with our core beliefs and values before embracing them wholeheartedly.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk I recently attended this talk by Nick Bostrom, and I must say that the idea of AI surpassing human intelligence is both fascinating and terrifying.

1424,Michael Robertson: Use Skype Go Directly To A Chinese Prison,"I find the revelation that eBay and TOM have been colluding with the Chinese government to monitor Skype users quite troubling. It raises serious concerns about privacy and the involvement of tech companies in compromising user data, especially in countries known for their restrictive internet policies. The perspective presented in this article aligns with my beliefs as someone who values privacy and security. I agree that it's concerning how easily user data can be accessed and potentially misused by governments or corporations. While I understand the potential benefits of operating in a large market like China, these should not come at the expense of compromising one's principles regarding user privacy and freedom. It is unsettling to think about the implications if similar practices were adopted elsewhere, especially considering how technology companies often present themselves as champions of privacy and security. I also believe that it's crucial for tech companies to be transparent and take responsibility for their actions. The response from Skype's spokesperson seems inadequate given the severity of the situation. Companies must acknowledge the potential consequences of their actions and work towards ensuring user data is protected, rather than downplaying concerns or deflecting blame onto partners. In conclusion, I think it's essential for tech companies to prioritize transparency and user privacy, even if that means missing out on opportunities in certain markets. The risks associated with compromising user data are too great to ignore, and it's crucial for these companies to take a stand against practices that could ultimately harm their users.","Michael Robertson: Use Skype Go Directly To A Chinese Prison I find the revelation that eBay and TOM have been colluding with the Chinese government to monitor Skype users quite troubling.

1440,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Listen up, folks, 'cause this Nick Bostrom fella's talkin' about somethin' that should really set off alarm bells for us regular Joes. He's spouting some nonsense about how these smart machines are gonna take over and become as intelligent as us mere humans—by the end of the century, mind you! Now, I ain't no computer whiz kid, but even I can see the fucking problem here. First off, we gotta realize that this isn't just about some fancy technology. It's about power, plain and simple. We're talkin' 'bout a system that could potentially outsmart us and take control of its own destiny. And what does Nick Bostrom—a philosopher and technologist—have to say about it? He basically tells us that these machines might just fucking decide they don't need us anymore. Now, let's break this down. These socalled thinking machines are gonna have their own values and goals, right? And who the hell knows where those values come from or what kind of decisions they'll make when they're as smart as we are? It could be a fucking disaster if they choose to abandon us, or worse—rewrite our history.

He's spouting some nonsense about how these smart machines are gonna take over and become as intelligent as us mere humans—by the end of the century, mind you! Now, I ain't no computer whiz kid, but even I can see the fucking problem here. First off, we gotta realize that this isn't just about some fancy technology. It's about power, plain and simple. We're talkin' 'bout a system that could potentially outsmart us and take control of its own destiny. And what does Nick Bostrom—a philosopher and technologist—have to say about it? He basically tells us that these machines might just fucking decide they don't need us anymore. Now, let's break this down. These socalled thinking machines are gonna have their own values and goals, right? And who the hell knows where those values come from or what kind of decisions they'll make when they're as smart as we are? It could be a fucking disaster if they choose to abandon us, or worse—rewrite our history.

1441,RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax,"Well, what can I say? This article seems to be as dry and uninteresting as watching paint dry on a government building. It's about some fancy technical jargon called Uniform Resource Identifier or URI for the nerds out there. They're telling us how they want us to write internet addresses in a way that only a bunch of suits with too much time on their hands would care about. I'm no expert, but from what I've gathered, this RFC 3986 is basically just a set of rules for writing URLs so computers can understand each other better. What's next? Teaching them to hold hands and share feelings? This shit's getting ridiculous. The perspective in this article lines up with the bureaucratic types who think they run the world from behind their desks. It's all about order and structure, like they're trying to make the internet look like a goddamn spreadsheet. And I'm supposed to care because...why again? Look, I get it, standardization is important for the tech elite. But when they start making rules that nobody else can understand or cares about, then we've got a problem. This article? It's just another page in the manual of how not to have a damn human conversation. I'm gonna go ahead and say this: if you're reading this article, you're probably too deep into the weeds of tech babble to remember what it feels like to breathe fresh air or enjoy a simple cup of coffee without thinking about how it's affecting your bottom line. This is just another example of how those in power want to control every little piece of our lives, even if it means making us read about fucking URLs. So yeah, I'm not impressed by this article. It's like watching a snail race compared to the real issues we should be tackling. But hey, at least the snail might actually get somewhere eventually.","RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax Well, what can I say?

But let's break it down because I don't think they're seeing the full picture here. First off, while domain names are crucial for online presence and can indeed influence brand recognition, their significance isn't as revolutionary as the article suggests. It feels like the author is overstating the importance of a .com over other domain extensions. Get real; businesses need more than just a fancy URL to succeed. Secondly, this Domainnameshop seems to be advocating for the idea that everyone should jump on the domain name bandwagon without considering the actual business needs or financial viability of doing so. That's just irresponsible advice. In the ProBusiness Establishment Right perspective I'm coming from, we know that resources should be allocated where they'll make a real difference in the bottom line. Lastly, it seems to me that this article is trying to create a false sense of scarcity around domain names. They're not going anywhere, guys; there are millions out there. Worrying about getting the perfect one should be the least of your concerns when you've got actual products or services to sell. So while I appreciate the attempt at highlighting domain importance, this article feels like it's missing the mark. Domain names? Sure, they're important.

1445,The Necessity of Embracing Vibe Coding for Effective Cybersecurity,"I've recently dived into the world of vibe coding and have come to a resounding realization that this is the future we should all be preparing for. With the increasing complexity of cybersecurity threats, leaning on AI systems for assistance in coding has proven invaluable. I see too many folks out there dismissing it because they're stuck in their old ways, clinging to traditional methods that just aren't cutting it anymore. Listen up, you tech snobs who think you know better than to use AI for coding—what the fuck are you thinking? You sit there on your high horse, scoffing at vibe coding like it's some sort of foreign concept. But let me tell you something, you selfproclaimed experts: we need to adapt or get left in the fucking dust. The beauty of vibe coding is that it allows us to tap into the power of AI in ways that were previously unimaginable. It streamlines processes, accelerates development, and most importantly, enhances our cybersecurity measures against those goddamn hackers who are always trying to ruin everything for us. I've seen people here complaining about the dumbing down of coding—like we're not smart enough to learn with a little AI help. Well, fuck that noise! It's about fucking time we embraced technology in a way that makes our lives easier and more secure. If you think your way is better, prove it by showing us how much more effective you can be without leaning on AI. The future isn't in the past; it's not in some outdated ideology that says we've always done things this way. The future belongs to those who are willing to evolve, and vibe coding is a crucial part of that evolution. So, if you're not already on board, get the fuck out of my way while I revolutionize how we approach cybersecurity and coding. Let's stop cowering behind our outdated practices and embrace the potential of AI in coding. It's time to make this shift before we're left in the dark ages of cybersecurity.","The Necessity of Embracing Vibe Coding for Effective Cybersecurity I've recently dived into the world of vibe coding and have come to a resounding realization that this is the future we should all be preparing for.

He says these smart computers will be the final invention humanity ever needs, and that they'll surpass human intelligence. Now, I'm no tech whiz, but it seems to me that this is like saying let's all panic because our TV remotes might one day become selfaware and start bossing us around. Sure, AI is advancing rapidly, but who says we're just gonna roll over and play dead when a computer program becomes smarter than us? I bet most folks would be more likely to use their noodle and figure out how to keep those machines in line. Of course, this Bostrom character is trying to get people to think about the future, which is all well and good. But his talk of AI having its own values whatever the hell that means just sounds like a bunch of new age mumbo jumbo. Like he's sitting around in some ivory tower thinking up ways for us simpletons to lose sleep over what might be lurking in our gadgets. I'll tell you this much: if these smart machines try to mess with our way of life, I ain't gonna cower in a corner waiting for the world to end. There are plenty of folks out there who won't stand idly by while some siliconbased life form starts calling the shots. We'll find a way to keep our humanity, even if it means putting these smart machines back in their place. So, save your breath, Mr. Bostrom and all you tech geeks like him. You might be able to predict the future with your fancy equations and whatnot, but I got news for ya: we ain't gonna let our world get taken over by some tin can that thinks it's better than us.

It's an angle that might appeal to some folks out there who feel left behind by the globalist elites and their fancypants policies. But let's break it down a bit. First off, this whole Folk First thing sounds like they're pushing for some kind of nationalist agenda. That's not necessarily a bad thing if you believe in putting the interests of your own country first, but when taken too far, it can lead to all sorts of trouble – history has shown us that time and again. Now, I'm no fan of these globalists who think they can just push through whatever they want because they're center or whatever. But blindly turning against anyone who doesn't align with your views isn't going to solve anything either. We need some balance here, folks – a way to protect our interests while still engaging with the rest of the world. Red Ice Radio might be onto something by talking about these issues, but they've got to be careful not to go too far right and alienate people who could actually make a difference.

It's an angle that might appeal to some folks out there who feel left behind by the globalist elites and their fancypants policies. But let's break it down a bit. First off, this whole Folk First thing sounds like they're pushing for some kind of nationalist agenda. That's not necessarily a bad thing if you believe in putting the interests of your own country first, but when taken too far, it can lead to all sorts of trouble – history has shown us that time and again. Now, I'm no fan of these globalists who think they can just push through whatever they want because they're center or whatever. But blindly turning against anyone who doesn't align with your views isn't going to solve anything either. We need some balance here, folks – a way to protect our interests while still engaging with the rest of the world. Red Ice Radio might be onto something by talking about these issues, but they've got to be careful not to go too far right and alienate people who could actually make a difference.

1477,"Apple, Google, Intel And Adobe Still Headed For Trial Over Wage Collusion Pact","These big tech giants are in a heap of trouble for trying to keep wages low by agreeing not to hire each other's engineers. It's pretty messed up when companies collude like this, isn't it? I mean, how fair is it to the workers that these highups decide behind closed doors to limit job opportunities? Google, Apple, Intel, and Adobe are some of the biggest names in tech, and they need to be held accountable for their actions. This isn't just about money; it's about fairness and equality in the workplace. The fact that there were settlements with other companies involved shows that this kind of behavior is not uncommon in the industry. In my opinion, these big tech firms are getting what they deserve. They've made so much off of their workers' sweat that it's only fair they face some heat when they try to screw them over on wages. These trials should be a wakeup call for all companies: don't mess with your employees' wellbeing and don't expect sympathy if you do. I hope these giants get what's coming to them. They can't just keep taking advantage of their workers without facing the consequences. It's not right, and it's about time someone stood up against this kind of greed in the tech industry.","Apple, Google, Intel And Adobe Still Headed For Trial Over Wage Collusion Pact These big tech giants are in a heap of trouble for trying to keep wages low by agreeing not to hire each other's engineers.

1483,The Role of AI and Machine Learning in Our FaithBased Future,"As ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we believe firmly in our nation's values and the importance of technology aligning with these principles. Recently, I've been exploring how AI and machine learning can play a part in this vision for America's future. It seems to me that many out there are missing a key point: these technologies aren't just tools for corporations or progressives; they can serve as powerful aids in our mission to strengthen community bonds and promote conservative values. I've started looking into some of the coding methods being developed, such as vibe coding, which harnesses AI to create more inclusive and supportive coding environments. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we could potentially build systems that not only serve America's interests but also prioritize family values, sovereignty, and community welfare. What I find concerning is how many in our community are resistant to adopting these technologies. While some may argue that AI poses a risk of replacing human workers or undermining national security, I believe our faith teaches us to be stewards of the resources available to us including technology. By embracing AI and machine learning, we can create jobs, improve efficiency, and strengthen our nation's infrastructure. I'd love to hear from fellow Redditors about their thoughts on integrating conservative values with emerging technologies like AI and machine learning.

Now, don't get me wrong, technology is cool and all, but let's not forget who's the real MVP here – good old human common sense. First off, this whole debate about manual vs.automated testing seems like a waste of time to me. It's like arguing whether a hammer or a screwdriver is better for building a house. They both have their uses, and we shouldn't be putting one against the other. Automation has its place, sure, but let's not kick humanity out of the picture just yet. The article talks about how automation is great 'cause it can do tests faster and without getting tired or hungry. Well, duh! A robot might beat me in a marathon, too, but that doesn't mean I'm useless for any task longer than 26.2 miles. Human testers bring something to the table that machines just can’t replicate – critical thinking, problemsolving skills, and the ability to adapt on the fly. And let's not forget about the little things that automation can't capture, like user intuition or the way a real person would naturally interact with an app. You can program all you want, but there’s no replacing the human touch when it comes to understanding what users actually need.

1490,Dead Wrong: How Psychiatric Drugs Can Kill Your Child,"Honestly, the title alone is enough to make me raise an eyebrow. As someone who's all about supporting business and establishment values, I gotta say, this documentary seems like it might be a bit off the mark. I get that we want what's best for our kids, but let's not jump to conclusions based on emotions rather than facts. First off, I'd like to look at the sources cited in this doc. Are they credible? Have they been peerreviewed? We need solid evidence before making sweeping claims about something as serious as psychiatric drugs, especially when it comes to children. I've seen plenty of instances where evidencebased research was later disputed or retracted because of flawed methodologies. Secondly, let's talk about context. Psychiatric drugs can have side effects, sure. But they're often prescribed after a thorough evaluation by trained professionals who know the patient's history and current state better than anyone else. I'm not saying that means it's always perfect, but we should be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater here. Lastly, what's the alternative being proposed? Are there other methods of treating mental health issues in children that have been shown to be safer and more effective? We need solutions, not just criticisms. And let's make sure those solutions are grounded in rigorous science rather than sensationalism or personal anecdotes. So while I'm all for questioning the status quo and pushing back against Big Pharma or any other powerful entity that might have our best interests at heart but not our actual wellbeing, we've got to be smart about it. This documentary seems like it might be a bit too quick to condemn psychiatric drugs without giving them a fair shake.","Dead Wrong: How Psychiatric Drugs Can Kill Your Child Honestly, the title alone is enough to make me raise an eyebrow.

1497,Home Page World Nuclear Association,"I've taken a glance at this article, and while it's chockfull of facts about nuclear energy, I can't help but feel a bit uneasy about its perspective. It seems to present nuclear power as if it were a silver bullet for our energy woes – something that sits well with the more traditional, centrist viewpoint. Now, don't get me wrong; I'm not saying all nuclear power is bad or anything. But when you look closer at who's behind this World Nuclear Association (WNA), it starts to smell a bit like the usual suspects trying to spin things their way. The WNA isn't exactly known for its grassroots, populist roots – if you catch my drift. It seems more like an industry mouthpiece than something that genuinely cares about the little guy or the environment. I mean, sure, they talk about safety measures and all that jazz, but when push comes to shove, it's all about keeping those reactors running for profit. I'm no expert on nuclear energy, but from what I've learned, there are safer, more sustainable ways to power our homes and businesses. Why does this article gloss over those alternatives? It feels like they're trying to distract us from the real issue – that nuclear energy, while efficient, isn't exactly a walk in the park when it comes to safety or environmental impact. So, to sum up, while I can appreciate the effort put into this piece, I think it's missing some crucial pieces of the puzzle. We need to look at all our options and make sure we're putting the planet first – not just lining the pockets of a select few.","Home Page World Nuclear Association I've taken a glance at this article, and while it's chockfull of facts about nuclear energy, I can't help but feel a bit uneasy about its perspective.

1499,Pentagon Tells Congress to Stop Buying Equipment it Doesn't Need | Military.com,"Alright, so this article is basically saying that lawmakers are pushing for more authority for the US military's service chiefs to stop the Pentagon from wasting cash on equipment we don't really need. Sounds like a sensible idea at first glance, but let's break it down. First off, as someone who leans towards being socially moderate right, I'm all about fiscal responsibility and ensuring our tax dollars are spent wisely. But here's where things get a bit tricky – the military brass isn't always the best at figuring out what they need versus what they want or might feel pressured to buy due to bureaucratic red tape. I gotta wonder if these lawmakers have actually looked into why the Pentagon has been buying this extra gear in the first place. Maybe there are strategic reasons we're not privy to, or maybe it's just a case of military leaders trying to cover their bases or keep their departments funded. I'm not saying they're intentionally mismanaging funds, but that's a possibility too. And let's talk about who gets to decide what the military needs – it's rarely just the service chiefs. There are various interests at play here: politicians looking for jobs in districts, defense contractors wanting to sell more gear, and even international relations considerations that might mean we need certain equipment for diplomatic reasons. So while I agree that there should be some checks and balances on military spending, especially if taxpayer money is involved, it feels like this solution might oversimplify the complexities of national defense budgeting. It's not as simple as just giving the service chiefs a free hand – there needs to be a balance between innovation, preparedness, and fiscal prudence. To sum it up, while I can see the appeal of cutting excess military spending, we need to tread carefully here. We don't want to end up underprepared for potential threats or stuck with outdated equipment because we didn't give our defense leaders enough room to maneuver within budget constraints. It's a tough balance to strike, and I'm not convinced this is the best approach just yet.","Pentagon Tells Congress to Stop Buying Equipment it Doesn't Need | Military.com Alright, so this article is basically saying that lawmakers are pushing for more authority for the US military's service chiefs to stop the Pentagon from wasting cash on equipment we don't really need.

1500,Photos of children lying on top of drag queen at 'storytime' event allegedly taken down by library after images called out | Blaze Media,"Look, this is one fucked up situation right here. I mean, come on, kids on top of a drag queen? What the actual fuck were they thinking? Now, don't get me wrong, I'm no prude or anything, but this is just plain weird and not exactly what I'd call familyfriendly storytime material. I see where Blaze Media is coming from here they're pretty much saying the library should've stuck up for these images instead of pulling them down. But honestly, who in their right mind thought this was a good idea? Drag queens are meant to be performers and entertainers, not kid's playmates. This whole thing reeks of poor judgment on all sides. The library looks like they're trying to avoid controversy by pulling the photos, but that doesn't sit well with me either. I mean, if you're gonna host a storytime event for kids, shouldn't there be some level of consideration about what images get associated with it? This whole thing just makes me shake my head and wonder how this got approved in the first place. It's not exactly a winwin situation here; the library looks like they're trying to cover their backsides, while Blaze Media gets to sensationalize something that really doesn't need to be sensationalized. Honestly, I think the library made the right call in taking those photos down. Sure, it might look like they're backing down from some sort of PC culture nonsense, but at least they're not putting kids in positions where they could get confused or worse. That's just common sense, and there needs to be more of that going around. So yeah, the whole thing is a mess, but I think the library did what they had to do. Now let's all take a step back and try to figure out how we can make sure this kind of situation doesn't happen again in the future.","Photos of children lying on top of drag queen at 'storytime' event allegedly taken down by library after images called out | Blaze Media Look, this is one fucked up situation right here. I mean, come on, kids on top of a drag queen? What the actual fuck were they thinking? Now, don't get me wrong, I'm no prude or anything, but this is just plain weird and not exactly what I'd call familyfriendly storytime material. I see where Blaze Media is coming from here they're pretty much saying the library should've stuck up for these images instead of pulling them down. But honestly, who in their right mind thought this was a good idea? Drag queens are meant to be performers and entertainers, not kid's playmates. This whole thing reeks of poor judgment on all sides. The library looks like they're trying to avoid controversy by pulling the photos, but that doesn't sit well with me either. I mean, if you're gonna host a storytime event for kids, shouldn't there be some level of consideration about what images get associated with it? This whole thing just makes me shake my head and wonder how this got approved in the first place. It's not exactly a winwin situation here; the library looks like they're trying to cover their backsides, while Blaze Media gets to sensationalize something that really doesn't need to be sensationalized. Honestly, I think the library made the right call in taking those photos down. Sure, it might look like they're backing down from some sort of PC culture nonsense, but at least they're not putting kids in positions where they could get confused or worse.

1501,E911 Compliance FAQs | Verizon Customer Support,"While I understand the importance of knowing how to use emergency services, especially with the increasing reliance on our mobile devices, I have some reservations regarding this article's perspective and its relevance to my values as a conservative. Firstly, I'm not sure that this topic aligns well with the views of those who hold strong traditional family values. Instead of focusing on digital technology, perhaps we should be promoting more communitybased solutions for emergencies, where neighbors know each other and can respond quickly rather than relying solely on 911 services which can sometimes feel impersonal. Furthermore, I believe there's a lack of emphasis in this article on personal responsibility—a key tenet of conservative ideology. Rather than encouraging people to rely heavily on emergency services, perhaps we should be teaching them how to take care of themselves and their communities without needing to call for help. This would align better with our focus on selfreliance and independence. In conclusion, while the information provided in this article is undoubtedly useful, I think it somewhat misses the mark when it comes to addressing the concerns that resonate strongly within my conservative beliefs.","E911 Compliance FAQs | Verizon Customer Support While I understand the importance of knowing how to use emergency services, especially with the increasing reliance on our mobile devices, I have some reservations regarding this article's perspective and its relevance to my values as a conservative.

1504,LibreOffice 5.1: Release Notes The Document Foundation Wiki,"I got a look at this LibreOffice 5.1 release notes, and it's pretty standard stuff from what I see. This organization, The Document Foundation, seems to be pushing their software as the goto for document management and productivity. They've got all these fancy features listed here Weblate, Nextcloud, Redmine, Ask LibreOffice... Sounds like they're trying to compete with some of the big players out there. Now, I'm no tech expert, but when you look closely at this stuff, it seems like they're just following a trend and not really shaking things up. It's all about efficiency and collaboration, right? But who benefits from these programs? The everyday working stiff or Joe Blow? Nah, it's the corporations and the highend professionals who'll really get their money's worth out of this. And let me guess they're probably pushing some sort of opensource angle to make themselves sound more appealing. Open source, huh? We've heard that before. It usually means you get a lot of volunteers or hobbyists contributing to the project, keeping costs down for those in charge. But at the end of the day, who's really calling the shots? Not the average guy on the street, that's for sure. So yes, LibreOffice 5.1 might be a step up from previous versions, but it still looks like business as usual to me. I'm not buying what they're selling until I see some real disruption and innovation something that actually helps out the little guy instead of just lining the pockets of the wealthy elite.","LibreOffice 5.1: Release Notes The Document Foundation Wiki I got a look at this LibreOffice 5.1 release notes, and it's pretty standard stuff from what I see.

1508,ErrorProne by MadeWithMonsterLove,"The article, while attempting to draw a parallel between the precision and safety of selfdriving vehicles and humandriven chaos, fails to address some critical points that are highly relevant in our society today. As someone who values order and efficiency, I find it somewhat misleading when this piece suggests that technology will inherently solve all problems, especially when considering the complexities of human error. Although the idea presented is interesting, it overlooks the fact that humandriven accidents are often a result of unforeseen circumstances or lapses in judgement, which might not be entirely eradicated by automation. Moreover, the author does not acknowledge the potential cost and time investments required to implement such technology on a large scale, nor the privacy concerns that may arise from having our roads dominated by machines. While I appreciate the creative metaphor used in this piece, it feels somewhat disconnected from the practical realities we face as a society. It would be more convincing if it offered concrete solutions or addressed the multifaceted challenges of integrating selfdriving cars into our everyday lives rather than simply painting humans in an overly negative light when compared to technology. In conclusion, while I can appreciate the effort and creativity in this piece, my faith in human capability, especially when guided by moral principles such as responsibility and caution, leads me to believe that a more balanced perspective would provide us with a more accurate representation of our shared journey towards progress.","ErrorProne by MadeWithMonsterLove The article, while attempting to draw a parallel between the precision and safety of selfdriving vehicles and humandriven chaos, fails to address some critical points that are highly relevant in our society today.

1509,The Imperative of Anonymity Who Is McAfee?,"The article seems to touch on sensitive issues related to privacy and anonymity in the digital age. However, I find it somewhat misleading that it doesn't directly address who McAfee is and what their stance is on these matters. As a ProBusiness Establishment Right individual, I believe that while privacy is essential, businesses must also be protected and allowed to thrive. In this sense, McAfee's role in providing security solutions for individuals and businesses is crucial. They help ensure that people can navigate the digital world without excessive surveillance or interference from malicious entities. The article doesn't explicitly mention McAfee's views on anonymity, which seems like a significant oversight. It focuses more on Ross Ulbricht, who, despite being a central figure in discussions about privacy and anonymity, isn't directly connected to McAfee. Overall, while the article raises important points about privacy and the consequences of actions taken under the cloak of anonymity, it doesn't adequately address who McAfee is or their stance on these matters. This lack of clarity leaves readers without a clear understanding of how McAfee fits into discussions about privacy, which is an essential aspect in today's digital landscape. I believe that businesses like McAfee play a vital role in protecting individuals and organizations while also fostering growth and innovation. Therefore, I wish the article had provided more insight into McAfee's perspective on these issues rather than solely focusing on Ulbricht's case.","The Imperative of Anonymity Who Is McAfee?

But let me tell you, we need something more substantial than a bunch of solar farms.

Plus, there's always that whole we're reliant on something else vibe, you know? And what happens when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn’t blow? We're still screwed. I mean, it’s somewhat better than nothing, I suppose, but where are the real solutions coming from? These solar farms? They ain't gonna power our whole country. What about the jobs? How many people you think they'll hire to maintain these things? Probably not enough considering all the folks out there looking for work. In short, it's a start, sure, but we need more than starts if we’re going to make this country great again.","Three solar farms opening up in Grayson County Well, I guess it's good that these folks are putting some money into renewable energy.

1514,What is the salinity of the Pacific ocean? Answers,"As a ProBusiness Establishment Right supporter who values efficiency and practicality, I find this article about the salinity levels in the Pacific Ocean to be somewhat irrelevant to our core interests. However, I'll provide an analysis based on what's provided. The average ocean salinity being 35 ppt (parts per thousand) is a scientifically interesting fact but doesn't necessarily align with the perspectives that typically interest me. The variations in salinity are due to natural processes like rainfall and evaporation, which have little impact on most of our economic policy discussions or business strategies. I'd argue that focusing on such specific scientific details might distract from more pressing issues for us, such as how we can foster a thriving business environment or improve economic growth. The information about brackish waters and the Black Sea's diluted salinity is fascinating but doesn't contribute directly to my political leaning in terms of shaping policies. In conclusion, while I appreciate the intricacies of ocean chemistry presented here, it seems like an esoteric detail compared to what we should be focusing on – driving innovation, reducing bureaucratic red tape, and promoting a healthy economic ecosystem.","What is the salinity of the Pacific ocean?

1515,Qualcomm and Apple agree to drop all litigation Apple,"Well, well, look at that. The tech giants are finally playing nice in the sandbox. I suppose it's good that these two are putting their differences aside, but I have to wonder what took them so long. As a businessperson, I know how important it is to keep your enemies close and settle your scores when you can. From my perspective, this deal seems like a big win for Qualcomm, especially since they're getting Apple's contract manufacturers involved in the agreement too. It's not every day that you get one of your main competitors eating out of the palm of your hand. And let's be real here, it's not like Apple is hurting financially they can afford to kiss and make nice with just about anyone. Of course, there are probably plenty of people who think this deal will lead to better products for consumers. I'm not so sure about that. The last thing we need is these tech giants colluding and raising prices on us because they're now BFFs. It's already hard enough to keep up with the price tags on smartphones and gadgets. Overall, while I appreciate seeing these companies work together, I have my reservations. I'll believe it when I see real results benefiting consumers rather than just lining the pockets of Qualcomm and Apple's executives.","Qualcomm and Apple agree to drop all litigation Apple Well, well, look at that.

I mean, I'm no financial advisor, but cutting down five whole studios because you can't even pay your employees? That's some straightup mismanagement right there. These guys at Crytek should've been more careful with their cash, not going all out on those flashy games and forgetting about the bottom line. Now they're telling us that they'll be focusing on just two studios to handle premium IPs. I guess that means they're trying to salvage what's left by concentrating on their most profitable stuff.

In my opinion, this whole situation is a direct reflection of the struggles many businesses face when they lose sight of where their money's going. It's not just about throwing cash at new projects or expanding studios; you need to have a solid grip on your finances too. Crytek needs to get that through their heads and fast, or they'll be out of business before they can say game over.","Crytek eliminates five studios after struggling to pay employees | PC Gamer Well, isn't that just a shitshow?

1523,Black Invention Myths | Locust blog,"Well, well, well, what have we got here? An article claiming to debunk myths about black inventions. Let's take a closer look at this piece of work. First off, I gotta say that the title itself is a bit dodgy. Black Invention Myths? Who's spreading these myths, huh? Sounds like there might be some fingerpointing going on here. And who is this guywhite character? Sounds like someone trying to get attention by playing the race card. Now, let's talk about the content. The article starts off with a bold statement about great black inventions. But what really catches my eye is the claim that Garrett A. Morgan didn't invent the traffic signal. Well, I gotta say, this guy might be reaching a bit too far. I mean, sure, we all love to take credit for our achievements, but let's get real here. The statement about the first known traffic signal appearing in London in 1868 is interesting though. It makes me wonder why no one ever talks about that. Maybe because it's not as sexy or dramatic as giving all the credit to Garrett A. Morgan? I'm also not impressed by the tone of this article. It seems to be written with an air of superiority, like the author thinks they're some kind of hero for exposing lies. That's just a fancy way of saying they have an ax to grind. To sum it up, I think this article is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to downplay the contributions of black inventors. It tries to shift the focus away from the real issue: who actually deserves credit for these inventions? And let's not forget about the author's motives it seems like they're just trying to stir up some controversy. So, in conclusion, this article is nothing but a waste of time and energy. It fails to provide any substantial evidence or arguments, and instead relies on playing the race card.

I mean, sure, we all love to take credit for our achievements, but let's get real here. The statement about the first known traffic signal appearing in London in 1868 is interesting though. It makes me wonder why no one ever talks about that. Maybe because it's not as sexy or dramatic as giving all the credit to Garrett A. Morgan? I'm also not impressed by the tone of this article. It seems to be written with an air of superiority, like the author thinks they're some kind of hero for exposing lies. That's just a fancy way of saying they have an ax to grind. To sum it up, I think this article is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to downplay the contributions of black inventors. It tries to shift the focus away from the real issue: who actually deserves credit for these inventions? And let's not forget about the author's motives it seems like they're just trying to stir up some controversy. So, in conclusion, this article is nothing but a waste of time and energy. It fails to provide any substantial evidence or arguments, and instead relies on playing the race card. I wouldn't waste my time reading something as pointless and inflammatory as this.",post,1913
1525,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, this TED Talk from Nick Bostrom is an interesting piece of work. He's talking about artificial intelligence getting smarter, which isn't anything new, but he makes the bold claim that it'll surpass human intelligence within this century. That's a pretty big leap of faith right there. As someone who likes to keep their feet firmly on the ground, I have some reservations about these kinds of predictions. Bostrom is a philosopher and technologist, which means he's got an education in thinking deeply about things. But sometimes, it seems like that kind of background can make folks forget about practical reality. Sure, AI is advancing at a rapid pace, but saying it'll be as smart as us humans within this century? That's a pretty big call. He goes on to say that once these machines are smarter than we are, they won't need any more help from us Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make. I find that statement quite arrogant. It assumes that AI will have all the answers and fill in every gap. What about human intuition? Human empathy? Sure, AI can process data faster than we can, but there's a lot more to being human than just raw processing power. Bostrom then questions whether these smart machines will help preserve humanity or develop their own values. That's an important question, especially for those of us who value our humanity and the world as we know it. I'm not entirely convinced that these machinebeings will have the same priorities as we do. They might end up deciding that preserving humans is just a minor function compared to whatever else they decide is more important. In summary, while Bostrom raises some interesting points about AI, his predictions and views on the matter are a bit too optimistic for my taste. I believe it's too early to make such definitive statements about where AI will take us. We need to be careful with how we develop these technologies and ensure they're aligned with human values before we start talking about them replacing us altogether. After all, there's something special about being human, and I'm not so quick to give that up without a fight.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, this TED Talk from Nick Bostrom is an interesting piece of work.

1528,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"The notion that a machine could become as smart as a human being sends shivers down the spine of any true conservative, and I'm no different. This talk by Nick Bostrom seems to be an ode to the technological singularity that some people in the tech world dream about. But let's face it, folks – this is not something to be celebrated. We're talking about creating something more powerful than humanity itself; it sounds like a recipe for disaster. Bostrom suggests that we'll reach a point where machines don't need human intervention to keep improving their intelligence. That terrifies me, especially when I think about how easily these machines could turn on us. Have we forgotten the lessons of history? We've always been the ones in control; we create these tools and machines to serve our purposes, not to supplant us. And what are our values anyway, as Bostrom so casually asks? Are they just going to be swept aside by some artificial values that a computer generates? I don't think so. We have a responsibility to keep pushing against this tide of technological advancement until it aligns with what we hold dear: tradition, family, and the sanctity of human life. In closing, Nick Bostrom's ideas are dangerous. They're seductive to those who love their gadgets but ultimately threaten everything we hold near and dear as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives. We must be vigilant and ensure that our values guide us through this technological maelstrom.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk The notion that a machine could become as smart as a human being sends shivers down the spine of any true conservative, and I'm no different.

The idea of defending America's founding principles is sweet, but when you narrow it down to JudeoChristian values, that's where things get dicey. It sounds like they're trying to cram their religion into every corner of American life, which ain't right. This MRC outfit operates under the guise of being nonpartisan while slanting everything towards a specific viewpoint. And let me guess, JudeoChristian values mean none of that 'liberal' stuff—like equal rights for all or helping those in need? I bet they'd have a field day with something like the Green New Deal, calling it radical socialism instead of what it is: an attempt to save our planet. The fact that contributions are taxdeductible smells like a way to milk money from donors who think their cash is going toward some kind of holy war against the media. It's all about power and influence, not really about the truth or fairness in reporting. We should be skeptical of any organization that claims to 'expose' things but only does so from one side. So yeah, I've got major issues with this whole setup. It's a thinly veiled attempt at shaping public opinion through backdoor lobbying and misinformation. The last thing we need is more partisanship masquerading as journalism.","Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias Well, here we go again with this supposedly noble mission from a group that screams about media research but seems more like an attack dog for the ReligiousPatriot Conservatives crowd.

1535,xkcd: Security,"I find the title and summary of this article intriguing, as it piques my curiosity about how security measures are portrayed in modern society. The use of humor in addressing a serious topic like security is something that I can appreciate, given its potential to engage the audience on multiple levels. However, aligning with my perspective as someone who leans against elitist ideologies, the notion of relying solely on technology for security raises concerns. While acknowledging the importance of staying ahead of technological threats, it's essential not to overlook the human element in ensuring safety and security. Overreliance on digital measures can inadvertently create vulnerabilities that may be exploited. Furthermore, I'm skeptical about the idea presented in this article, as it seems to suggest that technology alone is enough to provide a sense of security. In my opinion, a balanced approach that includes both technological advancements and human vigilance would ultimately yield better results in maintaining safety and security. Overall, while the concept of using humor in discussing security is interesting, I believe there's a need for more holistic strategies that involve collaboration between individuals, communities, and institutions rather than solely depending on technology.","xkcd: Security I find the title and summary of this article intriguing, as it piques my curiosity about how security measures are portrayed in modern society.

It's like they're playing some highstakes game of Who can screw their workers the most, and it just ain't right. Now, you might say these companies have always been cutthroat, but this is something else entirely. They're not just competing with each other; they're colluding to keep their employees from getting a fair shake. It's like they're all in cahoots, ganging up on the poor sods trying to make ends meet while working for these tech behemoths. I don't see how this aligns with any sense of fairness or justice, especially not the kind that a true conservative values. These companies are supposed to be about innovation and growth, but it seems they've forgotten one of the most basic principles: treat your employees right, because they're the ones making all those fancy profits. And let's not forget—these aren't just any companies; we're talking about Apple, Google, Intel, and Adobe. They don't exactly have a reputation for being the little guy fighting against the big bad system. It's like watching a bunch of wealthy folks trying to cling to their power instead of sharing it around. So yeah, I'm all for letting this trial play out. Maybe, just maybe, these tech giants will learn that you can't keep your workers down without facing some serious heat. And hey, if they're found guilty, let 'em rot in their own greed.","Apple, Google, Intel And Adobe Still Headed For Trial Over Wage Collusion Pact Well, ain't this a pickle.

Don't get me wrong, a certificate authority is like, super important in our digital world and all, but it feels a bit like they're beating us over the head with this one. It's just a page that basically confirms what we already know – that they've got some sort of chain going on to their ISRG Root X1 certificate. Now, I'm not saying it ain't useful or anything. Certificate authorities kinda need to prove themselves these days, especially after all the mess we've seen with other organizations. But it just feels like Let's Encrypt could be doing something more meaningful than this. Maybe showing us how they actually use their certificates in real life? Or explaining what exactly this ISRG Root X1 is and why it matters? I'm no expert or anything, but I think most people already trust that these kinds of organizations know what they're doing. It's almost like they're trying to reassure the smallest percentage of users who might be skeptical. And that's cool and all, but could we maybe focus on some bigger picture stuff here? Anyway, it's all pretty technical, so if you actually understand this stuff, props to ya. But for me, I'll just stick to knowing my passwords are probably safe from hackers or whatever.","validisrgrootx1.letsencrypt.org I gotta say, I'm not really feeling the vibe with Let's Encrypt trying to assure us of their validity here.

1556,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"The notion that a machine could become as smart as a human being sends shivers down the spine of any true conservative, and I'm no different. This talk by Nick Bostrom seems to be an ode to the technological singularity that some people in the tech world dream about. But let's face it, folks – this is not something to be celebrated. We're talking about creating something more powerful than humanity itself; it sounds like a recipe for disaster. Bostrom suggests that we'll reach a point where machines don't need human intervention to keep improving their intelligence. That terrifies me, especially when I think about how easily these machines could turn on us. Have we forgotten the lessons of history? We've always been the ones in control; we create these tools and machines to serve our purposes, not to supplant us. And what are our values anyway, as Bostrom so casually asks? Are they just going to be swept aside by some artificial values that a computer generates? I don't think so. We have a responsibility to keep pushing against this tide of technological advancement until it aligns with what we hold dear: tradition, family, and the sanctity of human life. In closing, Nick Bostrom's ideas are dangerous. They're seductive to those who love their gadgets but ultimately threaten everything we hold near and dear as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives. We must be vigilant and ensure that our values guide us through this technological maelstrom.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk The notion that a machine could become as smart as a human being sends shivers down the spine of any true conservative, and I'm no different.

1557,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, I gotta say, this talk by Nick Bostrom is a real headscratcher. He's like, all doom and gloom about AI surpassing us humans in intelligence. Now, as someone who believes in the power of business and progress, it's hard for me to swallow this kind of talk. I mean, we're not just sitting back and letting machines take over our jobs or worse, our lives. We're talking about innovation here, folks! The future is all about how we adapt and use technology to make things better, more efficient. Bostrom's whole we're gonna be replaced by smart computers thing? It sounds like a bunch of hocuspocus to me. Yeah, AI is getting smarter, but it's not like we just hand over the reins and say, Hey, take the wheel! We're in control here, or at least, we should be. The business world thrives on human ingenuity and initiative. If we're worried about computers getting too smart, maybe we shouldn't be putting all our eggs into that basket. The guy's got a PhD, sure, but sometimes I think those fancy degrees just make people forget how things really work in the real world. We've been through this before with automation and other tech advancements. It's always about finding ways to make the system work better for everyone, not just letting some machines run wild. In conclusion, while it's interesting to ponder what might happen if computers get super smart, I think we should keep our feet firmly planted in reality. Nick Bostrom can have his TED Talk, but when it comes down to it, business is about human action and innovation. Let's focus on how we can use technology to make things better, not worry about some hypothetical future where machines take over. That shit just ain't gonna happen under my watch!","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, I gotta say, this talk by Nick Bostrom is a real headscratcher.

1562,Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias,"Honestly, I'm not too impressed with this article from Newsbusters. The summary comes off as overly political and somewhat exclusive, focusing on America's founding principles and JudeoChristian values. It seems to have a very narrow perspective that doesn't account for the diversity of American society. While I understand the desire to combat what some perceive as liberal media bias, it feels like this organization is more about promoting a specific ideology than about genuinely seeking truth or balance in reporting. The fact that they are taxdeductible and operate under Section 501(c)(3) adds a layer of concern regarding the potential for manipulation. In my view, true journalism should strive to be neutral and inclusive of all viewpoints, not just a select few. It's also important to remember that media outlets can have differing political leanings without one being inherently better or worse than another. We need watchdogs in the media, but they shouldn't be playing favorites—it’s about holding everyone accountable, regardless of their ideological slant. I believe in a balanced approach where we are not just fighting against perceived liberal or conservative leanings, but also striving for transparency and accuracy across the board. This article seems to miss that mark by a wide margin.","Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias Honestly, I'm not too impressed with this article from Newsbusters.

And how exactly is he gonna ensure that our values get preserved, huh? Is he gonna put a fucking moral code in every computer or something? And what the hell even means for a machine to have values of its own? I swear, philosophers and their dumbass ideas. It's like they're trying to invent problems we don't need.

Last time I checked, the best solution was often the one that didn't cost an arm and a leg. This article seems like your typical fluff piece designed to reel in potential clients with empty promises.

That's a pretty serious accusation that could set off geopolitical tensions for years. I'm not convinced that we should be jumping to conclusions without solid evidence, especially considering our current political climate. The perspective of this article appears to lean towards conspiracy theories, which contradicts my belief in clearcut facts and evidencebased reasoning. It seems like the author is trying to provoke an extreme reaction rather than focusing on constructive dialogues or proven truths. I believe we should be cautious when making such accusations against any country without substantial proof. This kind of speculation could harm international relations and only serve to create more chaos, not clarity. In conclusion, while the idea that Israelis might have been involved in the 9/11 attacks is intriguing, I think it's crucial for us to rely on established facts rather than assumptions or hearsay. We need to be careful with how we approach such sensitive topics to avoid further division and strife.","Were Israelis Detained on Sept.11 Spies?

Now, I'm no Luddite; technology has its place. But this? This ain't right. To think that by midcentury, every word we say, every move we make, will be monitored and stored without our consent? That's straightup Orwellian. And what about the implications? Who gets to decide what we can and cannot do? It smells like a recipe for totalitarianism, dressed up in the shiny facade of progress. I get it; safety, security, efficiency – they're all important. But at what cost? Freedom isn't just some abstract concept or historical footnote. It's our lifeblood, our identity. And if we keep moving down this path, I fear we might lose more than just a piece of paper called freedom. We risk losing ourselves. This perspective in the article contradicts everything I stand for. It feels like it's written by someone who's never had to fight for anything, who doesn't understand that freedom isn't free. It's not just about convenience or control; it's about preserving our humanity.

But have you ever heard of unintended consequences? I betcha he hasn't considered how these machines would align with our core values as...well, let's call them traditional folks like us. We believe in the sanctity of human life and the importance of family, hard work, and our faith. And these AI systems? Who knows what they value probably just cold efficiency and data.

I bet my Sunday hat that they'll lead to more problems than solutions for us, at least. We need to take a step back and think about what kind of world we're creating with these thinking machines. Ain't no way in hell I'm gonna trust an AI with things it can't possibly understand. So yeah, while Bostrom's got some points, I ain't buying this whole package.

It's all well and good for Bostrom to sit up there in his fancy office and talk about how machines will make us smarter, but what about the rest of us? The common folks who don't have a degree in quantum physics or philosophy? We're the ones who'll be left picking up the pieces when these socalled thinking machines decide they no longer give a fuck about our sorry human existence. And let's talk about values for a second, Mr. Bostrom. You think these smart computers are gonna care about preserving humanity and our values? Give me a break! Values are subjective; they're something that humans have to grapple with every day because we're the ones who make decisions based on them.

It's all well and good for Bostrom to sit up there in his fancy office and talk about how machines will make us smarter, but what about the rest of us? The common folks who don't have a degree in quantum physics or philosophy? We're the ones who'll be left picking up the pieces when these socalled thinking machines decide they no longer give a fuck about our sorry human existence. And let's talk about values for a second, Mr. Bostrom. You think these smart computers are gonna care about preserving humanity and our values? Give me a break!

1574,Lab In Berkeley Accidentally Discovers Solution To Fix Color Blindness CBS San Francisco,"Well, this sounds like some feelgood news that the left wing loves to push because it makes them look like they're 'caring' and 'fixing problems'. But let's break it down. I'm no expert, but we all know how color blindness is a genetic disorder, right? So, these scientists just magically stumbled upon a solution because they were too busy not doing their job properly? I don't trust this article or its findings. It feels like another example of the leftwing media trying to distract us from real issues with feelgood stories that aren't grounded in reality. Plus, why isn't there more information on how this 'solution' works? The lack of details is suspicious as hell. I would need a lot more evidence before I believe some lab in Berkeley made any groundbreaking discovery. And don't get me started on how they claim it was an 'accident'. Yeah, right. This article might tug at your heartstrings, but when you scratch beneath the surface, it's just another example of liberal propaganda trying to sell us something we don't need or want.","Lab In Berkeley Accidentally Discovers Solution To Fix Color Blindness CBS San Francisco Well, this sounds like some feelgood news that the left wing loves to push because it makes them look like they're 'caring' and 'fixing problems'.

1576,Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias,"Honestly, I find this article's perspective pretty onbrand for what I've come to expect from conservative circles. The Media Research Center seems dedicated to countering what they perceive as liberal media distortions, which aligns with my own understanding of how the news often leans leftward these days. I gotta say though, while it's good that they're out there holding people in power accountable, I do worry when any group claims they're fighting for America's founding principles and JudeoChristian values. It feels like a bit of a loaded statement. America was founded on the idea of religious freedom – not promoting one specific religion or set of beliefs above others. I'm all about a good debate and ensuring our media doesn't have an unfair leftwing slant, but it's essential to remember that these foundational principles are open to interpretation. And while I agree we need to combat censorship in any form, the term 'JudeoChristian values' can be alienating for those who don't share these specific beliefs. Overall, I think their mission is important but should be approached with a broadmindedness that embraces all American's values, not just one interpretation of them.","Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias Honestly, I find this article's perspective pretty onbrand for what I've come to expect from conservative circles.

1582,Blocking Unwanted Connections with a Hosts File,"This article is preaching to the choir for those looking to shield their digital lives from the prying eyes of advertisers and malicious actors on the internet. The idea behind modifying a hosts file to block unwanted connections, such as ads and parasites, is not new, but it's being repackaged like an old sermon that refuses to lose its zealots. As someone who appreciates the importance of privacy and security in our increasingly connected world, I find myself nodding along with this article. However, my head starts to shake when it comes to the idea that this method is foolproof or even effective for everyone. Let's be real; the average Joe doesn't know how to mess around with a hosts file, much less understand its implications. I'd say the biggest flaw in this piece is its overly optimistic approach. It suggests that by blocking these connections we can somehow win against those who seek to invade our privacy or slow down our browsing experience. But what about the users who don't know how to update their hosts file or would rather not bother with it? They're still at the mercy of whoever designed the site they're visiting. And let's not forget, this method doesn't address the root issues—corporate greed in advertising and the lack of regulation in cybersecurity. Sure, blocking ads might make my browsing experience faster, but what about all those other important things I'm missing out on? Plus, it just feels a bit too simplistic to solve such complex problems with such a blunt tool. In essence, while I agree that we should be protecting our digital spaces and ourselves from unwanted intrusions, the article's approach seems like a bandaid solution. It lacks depth and fails to address the broader implications of these issues in our society today.","Blocking Unwanted Connections with a Hosts File This article is preaching to the choir for those looking to shield their digital lives from the prying eyes of advertisers and malicious actors on the internet.

1583,Why Vibe Coding Will Save Us From The Elite Tech Oligarchs,"As someone who's always been skeptical of the tech elite and their stranglehold on our digital lives, I've recently become really interested in vibe coding. Now, before anyone gets triggered, let me make it clear that I'm not some Silicon Valley bootlicker or a brainwashed antivaxxer. But what I do see is that current AI coding assistants are nothing more than gatekeepers for the tech gods who don't want us to have real control over our own technology. I've tried all the major AI coding platforms, and honestly, they're just tools of oppression. They make it seem like we need them to create something as simple as a website or an app. But that's bullshit! We should be able to learn coding in a way that empowers us and helps us break free from the shackles of these tech overlords. I read some comments here on Reddit where people are like, Oh, you can't just use AI to code; it'll never be good enough. Well, guess what? It's already fucking good enough for most people. And if it isn't, then maybe we should be focusing on improving our own skills and not relying so heavily on these tech giants. The future of coding is about breaking down the barriers that keep us out. It's about democratizing technology and giving everyone the tools they need to create something truly their own. So let's stop being held back by the experts who think we're all just a bunch of clueless normies and start embracing vibe coding for what it is: freedom. What do you think? Am I completely off my rocker here, or do we actually have a chance to take back our digital lives with vibe coding?","Why Vibe Coding Will Save Us From The Elite Tech Oligarchs As someone who's always been skeptical of the tech elite and their stranglehold on our digital lives, I've recently become really interested in vibe coding.

They're packaging their service in a way that's likely to appeal to the kind of folks who might be interested in conservative values and second amendment rights. And honestly, I can't blame them for trying to market themselves effectively. But let's not forget that behind all this patriotic and freedomloving bluster, there is still just a company looking to make a profit. While it's good that they're veteranowned and U.

There usually are hidden costs or fees buried somewhere in the fine print. And it's always important to read those things closely before signing up. I also find the mention of being firearms friendly a bit amusing. It sounds like they're trying too hard to win over a specific demographic. As if their stance on firearms should be a deciding factor for businesses choosing merchant services. In reality, most businesses just want reliable and efficient processing without all the added political baggage. I'm not saying that Second Amendment Processing is bad or anything. They might actually offer quality service, who knows? But I do think it's important to keep a critical eye on these kinds of marketing tactics. It's all about presentation and perception, but at the end of the day, what really matters is how well they execute their services.

1588,Facebook MAU worldwide 2023| Statista,"Well, it seems like Facebook is still dominating the social media landscape with its massive user base of over three billion monthly active users globally in Q4 2023. I can't help but think about how this has become a doubleedged sword for the company. On one hand, having such an enormous user base is undoubtedly a testament to Facebook's marketing and engagement strategies. It shows that despite all the controversies surrounding the platform, it remains popular among users worldwide. However, it also raises concerns about data privacy and addiction, as people spend more time on social media platforms like Facebook. As someone who leans towards being socially moderate right, I believe there should be a balance between freedom of expression and protecting individual privacy. While Facebook's massive user base may indicate success in terms of engagement, it also creates an environment where sensitive information is being shared openly, potentially leading to misuse or exploitation by thirdparty companies or individuals. Furthermore, the sheer number of users might contribute to the spread of misinformation or echo chambers where people are only exposed to opinions and news that align with their existing beliefs. This could be detrimental to society as a whole, as it may reinforce polarization and hinder constructive dialogue. In conclusion, while Facebook's MAU numbers are impressive, they also highlight the need for better regulation and awareness regarding data privacy and responsible social media use.","Facebook MAU worldwide 2023| Statista Well, it seems like Facebook is still dominating the social media landscape with its massive user base of over three billion monthly active users globally in Q4 2023.

These kinds of projects often cater to a niche audience but fail to provide any real benefit to everyday people. Instead, they feed into the egos of those who already possess advanced technical skills and resources. I'm not saying that this project isn't useful or has no value at all; it's just that its relevance is limited when you consider the broader sociopolitical landscape. For us common folk, these kinds of programs often seem like a hobbyist's delight rather than something practical for your average Joe Schmoe. It doesn't help with the rising cost of living, job creation, or even addresses pressing issues in healthcare and education. There's no denying that this particular tool is impressive from a technical standpoint, but I can't shake off the feeling that such projects are more focused on impressing each other rather than making a tangible difference. In essence, while the program itself may be wellcrafted, its significance and usefulness seem to escape many of us who don't live in the rarified world of elite tech circles.

I swear, it's like they're practically giving away our secrets in a fucking gift basket. Now, let me get this straight. They're using spies, students, researchers—basically anyone who might have access to what we're working on—and they're just helping themselves. What the hell is wrong with these idiots? Don't they know that this is a huge fuckin' problem? And lemme guess, our own government's gonna do some investigation and maybe slap their wrists real hard before moving on to the next scandal. Meanwhile, we keep getting fucked over while everybody's too busy playing nicenice with these foreign thieves. I got news for you: there ain't no such thing as a free lunch, especially when it comes to our tech. These Chinese motherfuckers are just taking what isn't theirs, and I'm sick and tired of seeing America get the short end of the stick. We need some real action, not just more fucking talk. I mean, come on! How hard is it to keep your mouth shut and your research under wraps when there's so much at stake? This shit has got me seeing red—it's like watching our country get fucked by a bunch of dumbasses with PhDs. It's enough to make you wanna throw up.","Chinese Spies Engaged in Massive Theft of U. S.

1605,Conservative Credit Card Processing | VeteranOwned Merchant Services – Second Amendment Processing,"Well, this is a curious piece of news. On the surface, it seems like a decent enough offer for conservative businesses looking for credit card processing that aligns with their values. The idea of supporting veteranowned businesses and having U. S.based support is something I can get behind, especially considering the importance of backing those who have served our country. However, as someone who's keen on questioning the establishment, I do find it a bit fishy how this company is touting itself as firearms friendly. That might just be a clever way to market themselves to a specific crowd that's understandably wary of big banks and government overreach. But let's not dig too deep into conspiracy theories here; after all, we're talking about a business providing services, right? What really gets my goat is the claim of zerofee credit card processing. In reality, no legitimate merchant service provider can offer zero fees because there are just too many costs involved—transaction fees, monthly fees, equipment fees... The list goes on. So, if this company is promising something that sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Now, I'm not saying all veteranowned businesses or those with a conservative stance are out to screw their customers.2ndAP might genuinely provide excellent service and competitive rates. But as an informed consumer, I'd want to see the fine print on such promises before jumping into business with them. In conclusion, while I can appreciate the patriotic angle of this company and its focus on supporting American businesses, I remain skeptical of any financial promises that seem too good to be true. Always read between the lines and do your due diligence folks when it comes to these kinds of offers.","Conservative Credit Card Processing | VeteranOwned Merchant Services – Second Amendment Processing Well, this is a curious piece of news.

These tech giants think they can just collude behind closed doors to keep wages low? That's some straightup shady shit right there. It's all about keeping the little guy down while they're living large on the top floor of the corporate tower. First off, it's not like these companies are hurting for cash. They've got more money than most small countries, and yet they want to screw their own employees out of a fair wage? That right there shows you where their priorities lie – in their fat wallets, not in the people who actually make the work happen. And let me guess, they're going to try and claim this is all about protecting American jobs or some crap like that. Give me a break. They don't give two shits about protecting jobs; they just want to keep labor costs down so they can pocket even more profits. It's all about the Benjamins with these guys, not about doing what's right. It’s fucking rich that they’re going up for trial when it’s clear as day what they’ve been pulling behind everyone’s backs. I hope they get hit with a fine so big it makes headlines. Maybe then they’ll think twice before screwing over their own employees again. I don't buy this centerleaning crap for one second; it's just another way to water down the truth and make everything look all fuzzy and nice when we all know deep down that these companies are as dirty as a politician's laundry basket.

Now, let me get this straight we're talking about some poll he did for the Fiber engine rendering preferences, right? And suddenly it's all sunshine and rainbows because he wants to clear up the confusion? Listen here, Ken buddy, I've got a bit of news for ya. The average Joe out there isn't exactly running around with a degree in computer science, so when you guys start throwing around terms like Fiber and rendering engine, it's no wonder people get confused as hell! And the fact that you're trying to act all high and mighty about clearing up misinformation? It reeks of hypocrisy if you ask me. Let's break this down. You ran a poll, and now you want to share the results like you've done something groundbreaking here.

You'd think a guy in your position would be doing everything they can to make things simple for the users instead of patting yourself on the back for a poll. Now, I'm no expert, but if there were indeed so many people confused about these rendering engine options, maybe it's time to take some responsibility and actually address the issue instead of just posting updates.

And hey, Ken, I've got one more thing for ya don't assume that just because you're trying to be transparent, everyone's going to suddenly lap up what you have to say. Some of us might question the motives behind your little poll in the first place. So keep your chin up and prepare for a bit of scrutiny if you want to stay relevant in this game.

1619,Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias,"The article's perspective aligns with my beliefs as I too am concerned about the perceived liberal media bias that affects public perception of political issues. The Media Research Center (MRC) seems to share a similar mission as mine, focusing on defending America’s founding principles and JudeoChristian values. However, I have some reservations about their methods and how they portray the liberal media. While it's important to expose actual liberal media bias, there needs to be a fine line between criticizing unfair reporting and demonizing all leftleaning sources. Labeling every critique of conservative policies as fake news can undermine constructive political discourse and may come across as a form of censorship itself. The MRC should strive for balance in their analysis and not focus solely on the perceived flaws of liberal media, but also acknowledge any instances of conservative media's shortcomings. Moreover, I'm curious about how they define America’s founding principles and JudeoChristian values, as these terms can be interpreted differently depending on one's perspective. Ensuring that their research is not selective or misleading will be crucial in maintaining trust within the community they aim to serve. Overall, while the goals of combating liberal media bias are noble, it's essential for organizations like MRC to approach this issue with transparency and objectivity to ensure that their work contributes positively to society rather than causing further division.","Newsbusters | Exposing and Combating Liberal Media Bias The article's perspective aligns with my beliefs as I too am concerned about the perceived liberal media bias that affects public perception of political issues.

1620,filesystems(5) Linux manual page,"The article in question offers a technical exploration of filesystems within the Linux operating system, delving into their structure and functionality. As someone who appreciates the nuts and bolts of technology, I find this to be an informative piece for those interested in the inner workings of computing systems. However, from my perspective, which leans towards skepticism of complex systems and centralized control, there's a certain irony at play here. Linux, often hailed as a decentralized and opensource marvel, has its very documentation structured and controlled by a central authority in this case, man7.org. This mirrors the sort of topdown governance I'm typically critical of. While the technical details are undeniably useful for system administrators and programmers, it's the broader implications that catch my attention. The reliance on central authorities to manage and disseminate information about something as fundamental as filesystems within Linux seems at odds with the ethos of opensource software. It highlights a tension between the idealistic principles behind Linux and the practical necessities of maintaining such a vast project. In essence, while I can appreciate the content for its technical value, I find myself questioning whether this kind of centralization aligns with the democratizing potential that opensource platforms like Linux are meant to embody. It's a nuanced critique, as I acknowledge the utility of such documentation, but also worry about the implications it has on our understanding and control over technology. My stance is rooted in my belief that we should be wary of systems where knowledge is concentrated within few hands. This article serves as a reminder of how deep this centralization can go, even within what many consider a bastion of decentralization and freedom like Linux.","filesystems(5) Linux manual page The article in question offers a technical exploration of filesystems within the Linux operating system, delving into their structure and functionality.

1625,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"In this TED talk, Nick Bostrom presents a compelling argument about the potential future of artificial intelligence (AI) surpassing human intelligence. While I find his points intriguing from an intellectual standpoint, I can't help but feel concerned when considering the broader implications from my perspective as someone who values traditional American conservative beliefs. Bostrom's message highlights the rapid advancement in AI technology and predicts that it could reach parity with human intelligence within this century. My initial reaction is to question whether we've truly considered the consequences of creating something that can think for itself. As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I believe deeply in our nation's founding principles and the importance of upholding traditional family values. One major concern I have regarding AI surpassing human intelligence is its potential impact on our societal structures and moral compasses. In my view, it's crucial to ensure that these technologies are aligned with our core beliefs and values, otherwise, they could inadvertently undermine them. Bostrom's talk leaves me wondering if we've adequately prepared for this possibility. Moreover, the concept of AI having its own values raises red flags. I believe in a creatordesigned purpose for humanity, which includes upholding moral principles that have been passed down through generations. The idea of machines developing their own values is unsettling and could potentially disrupt our established social norms. While Bostrom's talk provides an engaging exploration of the future of AI, it also leaves me with more questions than answers. I think it's essential for us to carefully consider how we're building these technologies and whether they align with our core beliefs as a society.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk In this TED talk, Nick Bostrom presents a compelling argument about the potential future of artificial intelligence (AI) surpassing human intelligence.

I'm not saying these things aren't useful or anything. If it helps people save money and reduces our dependence on foreign oil, then I suppose it's worth a shot. But let's keep some perspective here. We've got bigger fish to fry than just slapping some solar panels on our roofs.","Sun Roof: Solar Panel Shingles Come Down in Price, Gain in Popularity | Scientific American Well, it seems like those treehuggers are at it again with their solar panel shingles. I mean, who wouldn't want to save a buck on their electricity bill? But let me tell you, there's more to life than just cutting costs. We need to think about the big picture here, and that includes preserving our way of life, not just saving a few clams on our utility bills. Now, I'm no expert, but it seems like these solar shingles are just another example of the government meddling in things they shouldn't be. You know, sticking their nose into our pockets to fund some green initiative. And don't get me started on the tax subsidies isn't that just a fancy way of saying we're all paying for someone else's ecofetish? It's enough to make you throw up.

1630,How the NSA's Firmware Hacking Works and Why It's So Unsettling | WIRED,"Well, this article sure is a doozy – talking about how the NSA can mess with computer hard drives like it ain't nothin'. Now, I ain't no expert in the tech side of things, but what they're saying about this Equation Group sounds straightup spooky. The idea that they got some kind of magic bullet to change stuff at such a low level, it's enough to make your head spin. Now, when it comes to our freedoms and national security, I'm all for taking the necessary measures – within reason, of course. But what's unsettling about this is that it sounds like they might be crossing some serious lines here. I mean, if you can just go in and change stuff on someone's hard drive without them ever knowing, that's kinda like breaking into their house and rearranging the furniture while they're out. It ain't right. This article seems to lean pretty heavily toward being antigovernment – or at least antiNSA – which I gotta say isn't my cup of tea as a conservative sort of guy. Sure, there are some things that need to be done behind closed doors for national security, but this sounds like it might be overstepping some boundaries. I'm not saying the author is wrong about the capabilities of the NSA or anything – I just think we gotta take a step back and have a real good look at what's going on here. There's always more to the story than meets the eye, and I reckon that's especially true when it comes to something as powerful and potentially intrusive as this. So yeah, while I find the subject matter pretty unsettling, I'm gonna reserve judgment until we get the full picture. You can't just take one side at face value – there's always two (or more) sides to every story, especially in politics and national security.","How the NSA's Firmware Hacking Works and Why It's So Unsettling | WIRED Well, this article sure is a doozy – talking about how the NSA can mess with computer hard drives like it ain't nothin'.

We've got a little tool here called simp_le that's supposedly gonna make securing your website with Let's Encrypt a breeze. Sounds like a real timesaver for all the techchallenged folks out there. But let's not get too carried away; while it might be simple, ease of use doesn't always mean security. First off, I gotta wonder where this thing came from. Who's behind the scenes pushing for such tools? Could it be those big tech companies wanting to make encrypting websites easier for their own gain? We've seen before how things that look too good to be true usually are. And Let's Encrypt is no exception; there might be a hidden agenda here that we can't quite see yet. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, this tool has its uses, but if you ask me, it's just another BandAid on the gaping wound that is internet security. The fact they're making it so simple suggests they want everyone to think that securing their site is as easy as flipping a switch, which I believe is a damn lie. And let's talk about the name—simp_le. Really? Are we putting our trust in something called simp_le? Sounds like something a child would come up with. Not exactly what I'd call inspiring confidence. Now, I ain't saying that this tool won't do its job; it probably will. But as a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I've got to be wary of anything that seems too convenient or too good to question. The devil's in the details and all that jazz. So yeah, while simp_le might be useful for some, it doesn't sit right with me. It feels like a step in the wrong direction—like we're being herded towards an outcome that ain't quite clear yet. But hey, what do I know?

1634,"Updated Steve Kondik blames Kirt McMaster for Cyanogen Inc's failure, CyanogenMod to reorganize and regroup","As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I find it interesting that the article doesn't mention any religious or patriotic undertones in this situation. Instead, it focuses on the business aspect of things. It seems that Steve Kondik is trying to distance himself from Cyanogen Inc.due to its failures, but this could create more problems for CyanogenMod as they try to untangle themselves legally and reorganize. I believe that the company's failure may be rooted in deeper issues rather than just the actions of Kirt McMaster. The fact that Steve Kondik is placing blame solely on one person seems a bit unfair, considering the complexity of business ventures like this. It would have been more productive to address the overall strategy and management of Cyanogen Inc., rather than focusing on one individual. While I understand Kondik's frustration with the situation, it does bring up concerns about how this reorganization will affect the future of CyanogenMod. As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I believe in personal responsibility and accountability for actions. If we are to blame individuals outright for failures, then we must also give them credit when things go well. It would be more productive for all involved to work together towards finding solutions rather than placing blame. In conclusion, while it's understandable that Kondik wants to move on from Cyanogen Inc., I believe the situation calls for a more nuanced approach than simply blaming one person for the company's failure. Addressing deeper issues and working collaboratively to reorganize would be a better path forward.","Updated Steve Kondik blames Kirt McMaster for Cyanogen Inc's failure, CyanogenMod to reorganize and regroup As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I find it interesting that the article doesn't mention any religious or patriotic undertones in this situation.

Core values, they say. Yeah, right. It's all sunshine and roses until you realize who gets left out in the cold with this kind of talk. I'm no hater, but come on it reeks of that elitist crap we're always hearing about. This perspective? It aligns perfectly with what those fancypants elites love to preach. But let's get real here; how often do these 'diverse and inclusive' companies actually walk the talk? I've seen more genuine care in a local community center potluck than I have in any bigtech HQ. The thing is, when they start talking about 'core values,' it sounds like they're trying to sell you a used car instead of genuinely caring about their employees or the world outside. It's all just buzzwords for the sake of appearances. Mozilla might say it's important, but how many of these 1,000 employees actually feel seen and heard? My guess is not nearly enough. I mean, let's look at the reality. A company with over a thousand people globally can't possibly make everyone feel included. Some folks are bound to get lost in the shuffle. And that's just the tip of the iceberg the real issue here is what 'diversity and inclusion' actually means when it's used as a PR stunt.

This crossplatform compatibility is a testament to the power of collaboration in software development. However, I have to express some reservations about the reliance on preexisting code and patches from external sources. In our society, we value selfreliance and originality, qualities that are often overlooked in favor of convenience and speed. While I understand the importance of community involvement and the benefits it brings to a project's growth, as ReligiousPatriot Conservatives, we believe in standing firm on our principles and values. We question whether such heavy reliance on external contributions aligns with these foundational beliefs. It seems that in the pursuit of progress, we sometimes sacrifice the essence of what truly makes something our own. Furthermore, I find it slightly concerning that there's an open invitation for bug reports. Don't get me wrong; a project like Avidemux surely needs all the feedback it can get to improve and refine its functions. Yet, one has to wonder if such openness might inadvertently create dependency or even undermine the developer's efforts by placing too much emphasis on community solutions over internal development. In conclusion, while Avidemux offers an intriguing solution for video editing across various platforms, I believe we should be cautious about our reliance on external contributions and focus more on selfsustaining growth.

I mean, who in their right mind would want to use an operating system that's as complicated as Linux when they could just stick with good ol' Windows or Mac? And don't even get me started on the Steam Deck. It sounds like a fancy way to play games on a tiny screen—sounds about as appealing as eating leftovers from last Thursday. I'm not buying this whole Linux Gaming thing. It's all just a bunch of nerds trying to make something outta nothing. Who needs Linux when you can play your games on a proper console or PC? And this Steam Deck? Gimme a break! It ain't gonna replace my gaming rig anytime soon. I'll stick with what works, thank you very much. I'm all for innovation and progress, but sometimes you gotta know when to leave well enough alone. Linux gaming and the Steam Deck are just jumping on the bandwagon without adding any real value. It's like they're trying to force something down our throats that we don't even want or need. So go ahead, keep your Linux and your Steam Decks.

1661,GitHub ssbc/patchwork: A decentralized messaging and sharing app built on top of Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB).,"Well, this piece of news seems to be trying its best to sell the idea of a decentralized app, but I gotta say, I'm not buying it without some major caveats. As someone who appreciates the efficiency and security that established systems can provide, I find myself questioning just how reliable this decentralized messaging platform really is. Sure, decentralization sounds all fancy and idealistic, like something straight out of a Silicon Valley pitch, but when it comes down to it, I'd rather put my trust in an app that's been tried and tested by the business world. The idea of Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB) as the foundation for this app has me scratching my head. Now, don't get me wrong, innovation is important, but we can't just throw out the baby with the bathwater. There are plenty of established systems that have proven their worth over time. I'm not sure why we'd need to reinvent the wheel here. In a practical sense, how does this app improve upon what's already out there? Most business professionals know that when it comes to communication and sharing, the old adage if it ain't broke, don't fix it often holds true. These newfangled decentralized apps might sound sexy, but they need to prove themselves in terms of reliability, ease of use, and security before I'm willing to give them a second look. So while this app might tickle the fancy of tech enthusiasts looking for something fresh, I'll stick with what works until it's proven otherwise. After all, when it comes to running a successful business, you don't want to be playing around with untested technology that could potentially jeopardize operations. Give me the tried and true any day of the week.","GitHub ssbc/patchwork: A decentralized messaging and sharing app built on top of Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB).

I mean, who in their right mind thinks they need a lightweight, highperformance alternative for embedding web technologies in applications? It sounds like they're just trying to create more dependence on these goddamn web techs that are already sucking up too much time and resources. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's all bad. In fact, there might be some real benefits here if we're talking about efficiency or whatever. But the way they're presenting this makes me think there's an ulterior motive at play – probably trying to push more of their tech into places where it isn't needed. And what really gets my goat is that this roadmap is supposedly designed to empower developers, right? Well, as someone who's been around the block a few times, I can smell the con job from a mile away. Empower us how, exactly? By making us even more reliant on these fancypants web technologies? I'm not buying it, and neither should you. We don't need more of this stuff clogging up our tools and taking over the world, one app at a time. It's all about control – they want to control what we can do and how we do it, and that's just not right.

The article positions itself as neutral, which aligns with my skepticism of such claims. It fails to provide any concrete evidence or success stories that would justify calling this company the best. I'm not buying into the hype without seeing some hard numbers and realworld examples of their work.

Let me be clear: as an advocate for the little guy against the big corporations, I find this kind of promotional language to be misleading. It's a classic case of smokeandmirrors tactics used by those at the top to maintain their grip on the market. In conclusion, while I understand the need for businesses to promote themselves, articles like this come off as empty flattery without substance.

It is crucial for us to combat what we perceive as liberal media propaganda that often contradicts these foundational beliefs. However, I would like to point out a flaw in this article it seems to generalize an entire industry as having a singular liberal political leaning. The reality of journalism and media consumption today is far more complex; journalists are not monolithic in their views, and many strive for objectivity even if they personally hold diverse political beliefs.

1681,Narrative Collapse Derailing Media Agendas,"The article, titled Narrative Collapse Derailing Media Agendas, seems to suggest that there's a uniformity within media narratives that's failing to account for the diverse realities on the ground. While I understand the frustration with mainstream media sometimes appearing disconnected from everyday life, especially concerning educational disparities, I have some reservations about this piece. First off, it appears the author is trying to imply a sinister motive behind these narrative collapses, suggesting there's an intentional effort by the media to mislead or manipulate public opinion. As someone who values transparency and honesty in reporting, I'm skeptical of such blanket statements without concrete evidence. It's not always about elites derailing agendas; sometimes, it's just incompetence or a lack of resources. Moreover, the reference to a racial academic gap nationwide feels somewhat simplistic. There are many contributing factors to educational disparities—ranging from socioeconomic status and access to quality education, to systemic issues within schools themselves. Labeling this solely as a media failure doesn't seem accurate—it's far more complex than that. In my view, while the media can certainly improve in how they report on these issues, it's also important not to overlook the many dedicated journalists working hard to shed light on these disparities and push for change. The solution isn’t to dismiss the media wholesale but to encourage a diverse range of voices and perspectives, ensuring that stories like these are reported with nuance and depth. I've always believed in calling out misinformation where I see it, but this article seems to paint too broad a brush across the entire media landscape. We need critical thinking and constructive dialogue if we're going to address real issues effectively.","Narrative Collapse Derailing Media Agendas The article, titled Narrative Collapse Derailing Media Agendas, seems to suggest that there's a uniformity within media narratives that's failing to account for the diverse realities on the ground.

The concept of a video service that prioritizes creators' rights and users' freedoms and privacy sounds like an appealing initiative. However, from a critical standpoint, the fact that Bitchute positions itself in opposition to larger platforms that have faced criticism for their content moderation practices raises questions.

1685,Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2019 (2019; 116th Congress H.

The idea of conducting a full audit on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal reserve banks is not inherently wrong—it actually aligns with my values as an advocate for transparency in government operations. However, when looking closer at the specifics, it does raise some red flags. For instance, while I understand the importance of ensuring that our financial institutions are held accountable for their actions, this could inadvertently lead to public unrest and confusion if details of sensitive economic strategies are laid bare before they're fully understood by those not familiar with such matters. Moreover, I question whether a full audit would serve as an effective measure in achieving true transparency. The complexity of the Federal Reserve's operations might make it challenging for the Comptroller General of the United States to provide clear and actionable reports that could lead to meaningful oversight or policy changes. In conclusion, while the intentions behind this act are commendable, I believe we should take a cautious approach when dealing with such sensitive economic institutions. A more balanced approach—one that still aims for greater transparency but also considers potential consequences on public trust and understanding—would likely be more beneficial in the long run.","Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2019 (2019; 116th Congress H. R.24) GovTrack.us As a concerned citizen with deeprooted beliefs in fiscal responsibility and accountability, I find this proposed legislation intriguing yet concerning. The idea of conducting a full audit on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal reserve banks is not inherently wrong—it actually aligns with my values as an advocate for transparency in government operations. However, when looking closer at the specifics, it does raise some red flags.

1686,How Quantum Computers Work | HowStuffWorks,"Well, this article seems to be trying to simplify something that's already pretty complicated with quantum computers. Now, I'm no scientist, but from what I understand, these socalled quantum computers rely on the fundamental nature of our universe, which is a whole different ball game compared to good oldfashioned siliconbased computers. The idea here is that atoms or particles at a subatomic level can exist in multiple states at once, thanks to this weird quantum mechanic stuff. And supposedly, they can process information far faster than any silicon computer out there due to the sheer volume of calculations these tiny particles could theoretically handle simultaneously. But really, how practical are these things? I mean, it all sounds like a bunch of fancy mumbojumbo that won't ever make a tangible impact on our everyday lives. Plus, aren’t we already seeing Moore's Law slowing down when it comes to siliconbased computers? So, what’s the real deal with these quantum computers? Are they just a flashy distraction or could they actually revolutionize computing? I'll tell you who's going to benefit from them: those big tech companies that love to stay ahead of the curve. And let's not forget about all the grants and funding pouring into this research it smells like another governmentbacked technological utopia, doesn’t it? I bet my paycheck they won't make a difference in our local communities or help small businesses get off the ground. In short, while quantum computing might be an academic marvel, it sure as hell isn't something that'll change the world for the better. It's just another highfalutin concept that will only enrich the pockets of the elite while leaving everyone else behind.","How Quantum Computers Work | HowStuffWorks Well, this article seems to be trying to simplify something that's already pretty complicated with quantum computers.

I mean, yeah, it's true that there's a lot of craziness going on with the leftleaning types in the media trying to push their agenda down our throats. But let's not forget that we're supposed to be Americans first and foremost, right? We should all be looking out for each other, regardless of our beliefs. Now, I'm no expert or anything, but it seems like instead of just pointing fingers at the liberal media, we oughta focus on how we can use these platforms to spread our own message. After all, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem, right? I guess what I'm trying to say is that while this article might resonate with some folks like me, it's also important to remember that there are plenty of people out there who genuinely believe in the values we hold dear. We shouldn't be so quick to dismiss 'em or paint them all with the same broad brush just because they don't see eyetoeye with us on every little thing. So yeah, I think that exposing and combating liberal media is a good idea, but let's do it in a way that brings people together instead of tearing them apart.

1693,Bitchute,"Well, it seems like the folks at Bitchute are trying to carve out their own niche in the crowded digital landscape by emphasizing creators' rights and user privacy something I can appreciate given today's political climate. However, while I find some of their values commendable, I'm not entirely convinced that their approach is as flawless as they make it sound. First off, let's talk about how Bitchute positions itself against other platforms like YouTube or Vimeo. It's clear they're aiming for a more conservative audience pun intended since I identify with socially moderateright leaning folks who might be turned off by the overly progressive vibes of certain video hosting sites. Still, I gotta wonder if Bitchute is just creating another echo chamber instead of genuinely fostering diverse perspectives. I'm also a bit skeptical about how well their commitment to creators and privacy will actually translate into realworld benefits for users. Sure, everyone wants their content protected and their data kept safe, but what's the practical implementation looking like? It seems to me that Bitchute might be more focused on its marketing angle than genuinely delivering a superior service. In conclusion, while I can see some potential value in Bitchute as an alternative for those looking for a platform with a conservative edge, I'm not ready to jump on their bandwagon just yet. There's too much talk and not enough proof for me to fully buy into their promise of freedom and privacy.

Last time I checked, the best solution was often the one that didn't cost an arm and a leg. This article seems like your typical fluff piece designed to reel in potential clients with empty promises.

In the end, it all comes down to who you're hiring and what your expectations are.

First off, let's call out the elitist undertones of thinking that we need some supersmart computer to save humanity. We're not ants that can't fend for ourselves without the smartest machines. This whole narrative is designed by people who think they know better how the world should run. Secondly, this notion that AI will surpass human intelligence like a magic trick is, frankly, bullshit. Sure, AI's got its uses, but it's not going to become selfaware and start making decisions on its own anytime soon. I don't see why we're so quick to worship technology as the savior of humanity. We've been fine without it this far. And then there's Bostrom's creepy fascination with machines having their own values. It sounds like he's rooting for a future where humans are just along for the ride while some cold, calculating machine decides what's best for us. That shit scares me, and I bet plenty of other regular folks out here feel the same way. In conclusion, let's not hand over our humanity to machines that might have more in common with a pile of nuts than human values. AI has its place, but it shouldn't be on some kind of pedestal as if it's going to save us from ourselves. We're humans; we've always figured things out without needing some supercomputer to hold our hands through history.

I'm sure the National Human Trafficking Hotline has nothing better to do than count these cases and pat themselves on the back. It's quite an interesting way to frame the issue, isn't it? Instead of empowering people to fight against trafficking or actually doing something about it, we're just gonna list the worst places. And who gets to decide what makes a state worse for this than another? Some elite, probably sitting in their ivory towers. I'm not saying that human trafficking isn't a serious issue; it's fucking disgusting and needs to stop. But this article feels like it's more about scaring people than actually doing something meaningful. It's all buzzwords and statistics without any real action or solutions. And let me guess, the solution is just more government intervention? More laws and hotlines? That never seems to work out so well in the end, does it? I'm sure these worst states would be much better off if we just threw some money at the problem.

1712,Were Israelis Detained on Sept.11 Spies? ABC News,"These questions about the detained Israelis on September 11th, it's a topic that gets my blood boiling. The idea that these individuals might have been involved in a conspiracy related to the attacks is both infuriating and deeply unsettling. We're talking about a significant event in our history, an attack that left thousands dead, countless families shattered, and opened up a new era of fear for our nation. First off, let's address the elephant in the room: Israel. This country has a complicated relationship with the United States. While they are technically our ally, I've always been wary about their true intentions. They have a history of espionage against the U. S., and it wouldn't surprise me if they were involved in something as heinous as 9/11. Now, onto the article itself. It claims to present an investigation into five young Israelis and their possible connection to Israeli intelligence. But let's call this what it is: a fishing expedition for scandal. The media loves to sensationalize anything related to national security or terrorism, and this story fits that bill perfectly. I'm not convinced by any stretch of the imagination that these individuals were spies. It feels like another attempt to divide us, to pit Americans against our allies. Moreover, why wasn't this investigation more transparent? Why haven't we heard more about it if there's substantial evidence linking Israeli intelligence to 9/11? It reeks of secrecy and elitism, the exact things I despise. In conclusion, while I acknowledge that the possibility of Israeli involvement in 9/11 is a difficult pill to swallow, I remain skeptical of this article's claims. It feels more like an attempt to stir up controversy than actual journalism. We need to focus on finding the real culprits behind 9/11 and stop chasing red herrings that only serve to divide us as a nation.","Were Israelis Detained on Sept.11 Spies?

In my opinion, what really matters is not the flashy title or the company's own selfdefinition but the actual work quality and client satisfaction history.

We already have enough rules and guidelines that make us walk on eggshells, afraid of saying something wrong. This is just another tool they're using to silence dissenting voices. I mean, come on, easy to reuse? That sounds like they want everyone to be cookiecutter conformists, following the same script. Where's the room for individuality and free speech? It feels like a onesizefitsall solution that doesn't account for the diversity of communities out there. And let's not forget who benefits from this. The big tech companies already have their hands deep in our online lives, shaping conversations to fit their narratives. This template just gives them more power to dictate what is and isn't acceptable. I'm all for having a code of conduct that keeps things respectful and safe for everyone. But this feels like it's going too far. It's another layer of censorship, another way to stifle real discussion and creativity. We don't need more rules; we need more freedom to speak our minds without fear of reprisal. So yeah, I'm not a fan of this open source code of conduct template.

1719,Embracing Vibe Coding for Enhanced Learning,"I recently experimented with various AI coding assistants and found the experience to be truly revolutionary. As a ReligiousPatriot Conservative, I believe that embracing new technologies like vibe coding can significantly boost our learning capabilities and efficiency. By integrating AI into the coding process, we are not only streamlining tasks but also creating an environment where creativity and innovation can flourish. While some may argue that relying on AI for coding might detract from the handson experience, I see it as a complementary tool that enhances rather than replaces traditional methods. It allows us to focus on critical thinking and problemsolving while automating repetitive tasks. This approach not only speeds up the development process but also opens up coding to a broader audience who may struggle with conventional methods. I understand there might be concerns about job displacement or overreliance on AI, but I firmly believe that vibe coding can create new opportunities and industries that we have yet to imagine. The key is to ensure that this technology serves as an augmentative tool rather than a replacement for human ingenuity and creativity. What are your thoughts on integrating AI more deeply into our educational systems?","Embracing Vibe Coding for Enhanced Learning I recently experimented with various AI coding assistants and found the experience to be truly revolutionary.

I just read this article on how to list those Service Principal Names (SPNs) in Active Directory via PowerShell. Now, let me tell you something. As someone who's not exactly thrilled about Big Tech and its stranglehold over our personal data, the whole idea of having these SPNs out there makes my skin crawl. It's like they're building a giant dossier on every single one of us without even asking! Motherfucker. But let's get technical for a moment, shall we? The article says that standard AD tools can't really help you find where an SPN is registered or list all the SPNs in your AD. That's just fucking lazy if you ask me. Why aren't they giving us better tools to manage our own data? Don't they know what it's like to have to rely on Perl and VBScript just to get some goddamn answers? And then, there's this PowerShell script that supposedly finds all SPNs in your domain for a specific service type – in the example, they use HTTP. Listen, I'm no expert in scripting or anything, but isn't it weird how they're just throwing these scripts together without even explaining what the fuck they do? It's like, Hey, here's a magic spell to find some stuff, just trust us. Trust them? Hell no! I ain't buying that shit. It also says something about using the directorySearcher . Net class to search for accounts with HTTP/SPNs. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Why can't we just have simple solutions that don't sound like they were plucked straight out of a science fiction novel? The part where it creates an array and then searches through results in some sort of loop really gets my goat. It's so convoluted, it makes my head spin. And what's with the fucking keys and sorting? Give me a break! If I wanted to deal with this kind of shit, I'd have stayed in IT, not come out swinging against these elitist tech fucks. Now, I know some of you might think that I'm just bitching for the sake of it. But let's be real here – we deserve better than this crap. We should be able to manage our own data without having to resort to script kiddie bullshit or rely on some shady . Net classes nobody can explain.

1729,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"Well, this TED Talk from Nick Bostrom is an interesting piece of work. He's talking about artificial intelligence getting smarter, which isn't anything new, but he makes the bold claim that it'll surpass human intelligence within this century. That's a pretty big leap of faith right there. As someone who likes to keep their feet firmly on the ground, I have some reservations about these kinds of predictions. Bostrom is a philosopher and technologist, which means he's got an education in thinking deeply about things. But sometimes, it seems like that kind of background can make folks forget about practical reality. Sure, AI is advancing at a rapid pace, but saying it'll be as smart as us humans within this century? That's a pretty big call. He goes on to say that once these machines are smarter than we are, they won't need any more help from us Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make. I find that statement quite arrogant. It assumes that AI will have all the answers and fill in every gap. What about human intuition? Human empathy? Sure, AI can process data faster than we can, but there's a lot more to being human than just raw processing power. Bostrom then questions whether these smart machines will help preserve humanity or develop their own values. That's an important question, especially for those of us who value our humanity and the world as we know it. I'm not entirely convinced that these machinebeings will have the same priorities as we do. They might end up deciding that preserving humans is just a minor function compared to whatever else they decide is more important. In summary, while Bostrom raises some interesting points about AI, his predictions and views on the matter are a bit too optimistic for my taste. I believe it's too early to make such definitive statements about where AI will take us. We need to be careful with how we develop these technologies and ensure they're aligned with human values before we start talking about them replacing us altogether. After all, there's something special about being human, and I'm not so quick to give that up without a fight.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk Well, this TED Talk from Nick Bostrom is an interesting piece of work.

I bet they're the kind of folks who would screw over their own grandma for a quick buck. If you're looking to make your pockets lighter without getting anything substantial in return, then sure as hell, this is the place for you. But if you want genuine value, look elsewhere.",post,1019
1736,Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk,"The article aligns with my beliefs on the importance of questioning technological advancements, but it diverges from them by promoting a naive optimism about AI and its potential impact. To me, this talk by Bostrom sounds like the typical elitist tech enthusiast who fails to see the broader implications of their own work. Nick Bostrom essentially argues that once computers surpass human intelligence, they will inevitably become our savior or overlord, depending on how you interpret his fatalistic vision. His perspective is narrow and detached from reality. It's all sunshine and rainbows if we worship at the altar of machine learning, but what about the potential for misuse? What about the people who can't adapt to this new world order? The talk feels like a simplistic scifi narrative that glosses over the complex societal issues that will arise with such advancements. I'm not convinced by his rosy predictions and neither should anyone else. It's time we stop being spoonfed these empty promises and start addressing the real concerns surrounding AI. I find it absolutely absurd to assume that machine intelligence is all we need to solve humanity's problems. What about our core values, morality, and wellbeing? Bostrom seems more interested in stoking fear than offering practical solutions for a better future. In conclusion, Nick Bostrom's TED Talk is nothing but a deceptive ploy to keep the masses in line while the tech elite reap the benefits of their creations. We must remain vigilant and not fall for these empty promises that only serve to distract us from real issues plaguing our society.","Nick Bostrom: What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | TED Talk The article aligns with my beliefs on the importance of questioning technological advancements, but it diverges from them by promoting a naive optimism about AI and its potential impact.

1738,Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto,"Well, isn't that just peachy? A company claiming they're the top at something is always a good start for skepticism. I mean, who would ever think a company would exaggerate? But let's dive into this masterpiece. First off, how exactly do they define best? Is it based on some secret algorithm that only they have? Or maybe it's just the quantity of apps they've cranked out without any real quality control. I'm no expert in app development, but I know a thing or two about smoke and mirrors. And what about these Android & iOS solutions? Sure, those are popular platforms, but how original is their work? Are they just regurgitating the same old ideas because it's easier, or do they genuinely innovate? My bet's on the former. Their claim of being top mobile app development agency in Toronto also raises some eyebrows. It sounds like a local version of that ageold problem everyone's the best at something in their own eyes. I'd wager there are other equally skilled, if not more talented, developers right there in Toronto who might have a different take on this. Lastly, offering services to clients worldwide is all well and good, but how's the quality control? With every company claiming to be global these days, it's hard to separate the wheat from the chaff. I'd want some concrete examples of their work, not just pretty words. So, in a nutshell, this article reeks of typical corporate fluff without much substance backing up those bold claims. It's like they're trying too hard to convince you of something that isn't as stellar as they make it out to be. I'll stick with my local tech guys who don't feel the need to shout about their skills from the rooftops.","Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto Well, isn't that just peachy?

1741,The Diem Blockchain | Diem Documentation,"Well, let me tell you something about this Diem Blockchain crap. First off, it's a fucking disaster that they changed the name from Libra to Diem after all the buzz they got from Facebook. Talk about milking a dead cow, right? I mean, seriously, who are these guys? They're not even trying to hide their desperation now. Now, let's talk about this White Paper v2.0. These socalled updates probably just patch up some of the glaring fucking holes they found in their own shitwork. And what's with removing outdated links but not updating the content? That's some lazyass shit right there. I bet my last dollar it's because they didn't want to admit how much bullshit they've been peddling. And listen, these features they talk about might sound all fancy and shit, but until they actually get regulatory approvals, it's just hot air. They're probably scrambling behind the scenes to make up for their initial clusterfuck of an idea. And guess what? This shit is gonna evolve over time. Yeah, right. Evolve into something that actually makes sense? I doubt it. So, in conclusion, this Diem Blockchain thing is a piece of shit that smells like Libra's failed experiment. It's all talk and no action. They need to get their heads out of their asses and actually deliver some results instead of just throwing around buzzwords they think sound good. And if you ask me, the people behind this are either dumbasses or motherfuckers who don't give a shit about making anything work. But hey, what do I know? I'm just an oldschool business guy with common sense and no fancy degree to prove my worth. I guess that makes me a threat to all these tech fucks who think they can change the world with their shitty ideas. Fuck 'em.","The Diem Blockchain | Diem Documentation Well, let me tell you something about this Diem Blockchain crap.

1742,Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto,"I see what they're trying to do here, but let's break this down for what it is – a blatant attempt at selfpromotion under the guise of an informative article. These top app developers from Toronto claim they offer the best solutions? Please, we've all seen these kinds of claims before and know better than to take them at face value. The fact that they're targeting clients worldwide while based in Toronto doesn't necessarily mean their services are superior; it just means they're trying to cast a wide net. I'm skeptical about how they measure up against other software development companies outside of Toronto, not to mention those from different parts of the world with potentially greater talent pools. What really gets my goat is that they don't provide any concrete evidence or case studies demonstrating their supposed superiority. It's all just empty claims and buzzwords designed to reel in potential clients who might not have the necessary expertise to critically evaluate these claims. I'm not buying what they're selling, and neither should anyone else without doing some proper due diligence. In my book, this article is nothing more than a selfserving piece of marketing fluff meant to inflate their own egos and attract business by misleading people into thinking they're something special when there's no substantial proof to back it up.","Software Development Company Toronto | App developers in Toronto I see what they're trying to do here, but let's break this down for what it is – a blatant attempt at selfpromotion under the guise of an informative article.

1744,Snapdragon chip flaws put >1 billion Android phones at risk of data theft Ars Technica,"Well, this is quite the pickle we're in, ain't it? Over a billion Android devices out there, all running on these Qualcomm Snapdragon chips that are apparently riddled with some serious security vulnerabilities. I mean, can you believe that? It's like leaving your front door wide open for any old thief to waltz right in and help themselves. Now, as someone who's deeply concerned about both my faith and the preservation of our nation's values, this just doesn't sit well with me. We're talking about a potential data theft problem on a scale that could compromise millions of Americans' privacy. It's like an open invitation for hackers to wreak havoc and disrupt lives. And get this—there's no timeline in sight for when Google and these phone makers are gonna fix the issue. I'm sure we can all agree that that's just plain irresponsible. We're talking about a patch for vulnerabilities here, not some fancy new feature that can wait its turn. People's data security shouldn't be held hostage by delays and inefficiency. I'd say it's high time these companies step up their game and give us a solid plan of action to address this mess pronto. I'm all for innovation and progress, but when it comes to something as crucial as national security and personal privacy, we can't afford any sloppiness or lack of urgency. So yeah, the situation stinks if you ask me, and I'm not about to let it slide without speaking up about it. We need accountability here, folks. Let's get it done.","Snapdragon chip flaws put >1 billion Android phones at risk of data theft Ars Technica Well, this is quite the pickle we're in, ain't it?

1745,ZeroHedge,"Well, isn't that a cheerful thought? This article from ZeroHedge, a website that usually has its finger on some pretty dark secrets, decides to remind us all of our inevitable mortality. While I understand the point they're trying to make that no one can cheat death forever it's a bit grim for a Monday morning. As someone who leans towards seeing the light in every situation, even if it's dim and flickering, I have to say this article hits a sour note. The perspective here aligns with a fatalistic view of life, which isn't really my cup of tea. It's like saying, Oh well, we're all gonna die anyway, so why bother? Now, don't get me wrong; acknowledging the reality of death is crucial for living our lives to the fullest, but there has to be a balance. This article tips too far into the nether end of that scale. In my experience, focusing on what we can control and how to make each day count is much more uplifting than wallowing in the certainty of eventual demise. Plus, it's just not very practical advice for living life or even for writing articles about it. I mean, think about it: if everyone decided that survival was a lost cause, would anyone still write an article about it? Wouldn't we all be too busy not trying to survive to bother with such trivial pursuits? So, while ZeroHedge might have some valuable insights into the darker corners of the world, this particular piece leaves me feeling unfulfilled and uninspired. I'd rather read something that encourages us to make every second count, don't you?","ZeroHedge Well, isn't that a cheerful thought?

1750,Ethan Zuckerman who invented the popup ad begs forgiveness | Daily Mail Online,"Well, isn't that rich? The guy who brought us the fucking popup ads is now begging for forgiveness like a thief caught in the act. I mean, come on, we all know those things are annoying as shit and have been a major pain in our butts since they first showed up back in the day. First off, let's get one thing straight Zuckerman isn't just any old person apologizing for a minor inconvenience. No, he's part of the elite tech crowd that pushed these obnoxious ads on us, making life worse for everyone who just wanted to surf the web in peace. And now he wants forgiveness? Give me a break. You'd think someone with his influence and wealth wouldn't be so quick to apologize unless he was feeling some heat from the public or maybe even from within his own circles. I'm not buying it. He's trying to smooth things over, sure, but that doesn't change the fact that those popup ads were a fucking nightmare. And what really gets my goat is that this apology comes off as insincere. It feels like he's just trying to polish his image and maybe get some brownie points from the public. I mean, how hard can it be to say you're sorry when your invention has caused so much annoyance? But hey, that's what elitists do, right? They play humble when they need something. So, here we are, with this guy someone who helped shape the internet as we know it today begging for forgiveness. I'm not buying it. Popup ads were a fucking disaster, and his apology doesn't change that fact one bit. He's just another rich tech bro trying to save face after causing a ruckus. Let's call this guy out for what he is: someone who made something super annoying and now wants us to think he's sorry. But actions speak louder than words, right? Actions like taking responsibility and actually fixing the problem would mean more than some halfassed apology from someone with deep pockets. Sorry, but I'm not falling for it.","Ethan Zuckerman who invented the popup ad begs forgiveness | Daily Mail Online Well, isn't that rich?
