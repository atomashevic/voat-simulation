"Here are some quotes from the Obama campaign articles:  technologyreview.com  they enabled a presidential candidate to view the electorate the way local candidates do: as a collection of people who make up a more perfect union, each of them approachable on his or her terms, their changing levels of support and enthusiasm open to measurement and, thus, to respect. “What that gave us was the ability to run a national presidential campaign the way you’d do a local ward campaign,” Simas says. “You know the people on your block. People have relationships with one another, and you leverage them so you know the way they talk about issues, what they’re discussing at the coffee shop.”  nytimes.com  Messina, the campaign manager, often boasted about how the Obama 2012 effort would be “the most data-driven campaign ever.” But what that truly meant — the extent to which the campaign used the newest tech tools to look into people’s lives and the sheer amount of personal data its vast servers were crunching — remained largely shrouded. The secrecy around the operation was partly because the president’s strategists wanted to maintain their competitive edge. But it was also no doubt because they worried that practices like “data mining” and “analytics” could make voters uncomfortable.  infoworld.com  With the success of this initiative, a unified big data analytics environment is sure to take its place as a standard requirement for campaigns to come.  They make it sound so innocent and normal."

"It's very difficult to get a private pilot's license. The assholes will sell very small 'ultra-light' type vehicles and call them 'cars' to get around the license restrictions, but people will die, and the shit will get banned. The problem with robots and flight is still an energy use problem, the problem is the energy required to move a man is not worth the cost, better to have nano-bot fly's that just fly in swarms, and licensed like drones. Space learned long ago that human flight is worthless, and humans on earth will learn that its better to wear a virtual reality head-gear and enjoy the thrill, but the actual cost of human flight is not worth the cost."

"Since the governments claim control over the entire telecommunications spectrum - and they also grant companies service monopolies ( a special economic privilege,)  within that spectrum, the government also has a legal duty to oversee the operations of the service providers, to ensure acceptable public standards are met.  This is normally not an issue. However, when you get regimes such as the Obama admin, who make themselves susceptible to regulatory capture (see bribery,) then the entire administrative framework breaks down, because the enforcement agency, the government, then becomes a protection racket for the criminals... to the detriment of the public.  Classic mafia tactics.  However, now this opens the door for customers to sue the FCC directly for failure to police the system.  Because the FCC claims enforcement authority over the spectrum - they also receive the ultimate legal responsibility to see the job is done.  Effectively, the buck must now stop at the FCC.   So the FCC will be forced to step in, and they might deservedly toss Time Warner to the wolves - but I doubt that will happen."

"You're correct that the constraint is not really available land, at least not in the U.S. Japan or other small countries might benefit a lot from this, but that's actually beside the point. Concentrating the growing area and minimizing soil use means far less pesticides, far more efficient irrigation, less harvesting labor, and basically greener healthier food. Those are all net positives that could outweigh the cost of the structure in the long run. I totally agree with the article that this isn't going to feed any of the places that are starving -- starvation, as the article observes, is a human-created condition that has nothing to do with food production. Dismissing the technology as useless because it doesn't solve one particular problem is a bit short-sighted."

"AFAIK the samsung issue had nothing to do with the charger or cable. LiIon charging is complicated and the management of it is done on the device. This is true for phones, laptops, cars, etc. The charger supplies a voltage (in some cases the charger can supply a specific requested voltage) and the management chip monitors (or/and adjusts) things like voltage, temperature, current, balancing, etc. There should also be some degree of filtering on the device, but filtering is bulky and should be done on the charger. So basically, the phone should check for the correct amount of voltage, available current, and noise, and use that to reject; they should not be using ""their blessing""."

"No, it's not easy. Apple replaces SMS with its own IM when all parties are iPhone users. Migrating to Android makes all your iPhone contacts send messages through that IM service, so you're effectively unable to receive messages from them."
Engineers have solved the problem of cheaply providing clean 5VDC power at 2A for like 40 years now. This is DRM marketed as safety. Just don't buy a $0.30 charger from AliExpress and you'll be fine.

"Yeah but does it really though? How long are we talking here, because if the lifespan of a computer goes from 8 years to 6 years... it's irrelevant, because the computer will be far too outdated anyway."

"Fair point but every manufacturer of every product does as well.  It's really hard now to find a device, machine, tool, or other item that is designed to last 5+ years unless you're willing to pay through the roof for it and ongoing service."
This is true. I'm not a big fan for many similar reasons.
"All three of them are misleading, if you expect them to be equivalent to an actual installation.  I have laid some slate, and in an actual installation, the tiles are not supported just on the edges like that- they're laid on top of each other, so there is always at least 2 layers, with a 3"" band every row where they're three layers thick.  See this edge-on view.  Slate isn't perfectly smooth, so it's not a continuous contact, and there's a void between the lowest layer and the roof, but it's a lot better than being held at the edges like that.  I suspect the ceramic tiles are similar.  I have no idea how the tesla tiles are laid.  It would be a lot more informative if they installed all three types correctly over a few square feet then repeated that test, since that's the information that's actually relevant."
"why are we bothering with electric cars now when we can have hydrogen generated on the fly?  For me, the nearest hydrogen filling service is about 25 miles from my house.

"the comments all had the same text, and the names appeared in exactly alpha order. If it were just the same copy paste message, one could assume a major group pushed something out to a really big email list. Amazing engagement, but not impossible. The fact that the comments that WERE left appeared in alpha order of names, though, indicates that a bot was used to put them there. No way that happens on a large scale by coincidence."
"I'll add my 2 paisa to this. Capacitive touch screens are extremely sensitive to noise from a bad charging wire. Your average bridge rectifier and a low pass filter in cheap rip off D.C. chargers won't cut it. Apple's chargers literally have a tiny ARM cpu in them - it's sole purpose is to perform sophisticated control over the DC signal over the charging cable.  Will your cheap adapters not work at all? Well, most of the time you don't have water droplets or any charged surface or varying magnetic fields near your touchscreen while you use it - so a cheap adapter can work for you.  On the other hand, apple can not make a product that can damage your touch screen or endorse other chargers that can damage your touch screen.  I'm just talking about the implications of an inferior charger on a touch screen here. There are also the various antennas, pmic chips, magnetometer sensors etc to worry about. Buy the original- there's a ton of technology behind the scene that's pretty incredible if once you are aware of all that's going on with that little charger."

"My jaw dropped when I read the specs. Doing the energy calculation, it can hold just under 13000 Joules of charge, which is comparable to a battery of similar  size lithium AA battery (assuming 2900mA-Hour @1.5v)... [edited to include accurate comparisons] It is still mindbogglingly impressive that we have this now. [edit 2] A good NiPo battery of comparable size and weight can hold ~190,000 Joules, which is a little over 15x what this capacitor can hold. Still, this is a fantastic stride forward in energy storage technology."
"Yeah sure, track them down in other countries... Never mind other countries' sovereignty or the fact that it's possible to hide the true source of any attack.

"They're two sides of the exact same coin. Republican authoritarianism last took shape in the form of the moral majority which was just as idiotic as the current regressive left, and were vastly more powerful. They played a major role in putting politicians into office all the way to the presidency and also helped shape various legislation which pandered to their interests. You can still see the remnants of his influence in the social authoritarianism in the republican party today. In any case yeah they were huge fans of trying to ban/censor anything that offended ""family values"" - video games, television, even board games. The current loonies are very vocal but I think largely thanks to social media rather than actual numbers. Everything that panders to the regressive left ends up flopping - be it video games or even a president. And I think that's largely because in spite of their voice, their numbers and support are extremely low.  Both sides do the exact same insanity. I think what we need is proportional representation. If 15% of people vote libertarian, or green, then 15% of seats in our congress should be taken by those parties. Thanks to our voting system, it's 0%. That's a problem since it means the old dinosaurs of US politics, democrats and republicans, hold effectively 100% of the power even though they represent fewer people than ever."

"I think MS is actually very dishonest - they knew about the issue, patched it in the newer versions of Windows, and deliberately left it unpatched in the older systems to force people to upgrade. So even if the NSA had informed them, nothing would have changed. And apart from shifting the blame to the NSA instead of to where it belongs (retarded managers who use outdated insecure systems for important work), I completely agree. You can't produce top notch security for old operating systems no-one pays a cent to update. If you want someone to do something for you, you need to pay something. That's why the banks, who also use XP and such, were not affected: They paid for special upgrades."

"I came here to say this. Regardless of where your politics lie. Microsoft ended all support for Windows XP and allowed for specialized and very expensive extended support for Windows Server  2003 which has the same equivalent architecture and runtimes. Microsoft built a patch possibly way earlier because someone with that extended support requested a hotfix for it, or they internally noticed it and released a patch. Think of it like a Toyota ot a Honda. Back in 2002, 15 years ago, there parts in any auto store for your car. It was profitable for the mechanics and the manufacturer to know how to fix your car, and have replacement parts on hand to fix it. Now it's more expensive to fix your car constantly. Some people keep their cars as long as they can, most trade them away and get something​ new and shiny.  Microsoft released a fix for free for all of it's cars, even ones not in manufacture any longer as soon as possible. You can even get it if you pirate your OS.  Regardless of how you feel about their politics. What they did as a company in this instance deserves nothing but respect."
"exactly this...  ransomware isn't new, and a global attack was inevitable... I called it happening to my university years ago, because they are inept... It happened last year, and revealed that they were weeks behind schedule in making regular backups and were completely unprepared for it when it did happened.     This is the wake-up call for many, but there will still be those who remain vulnerable because they think it just won't happen to them"
"The message isn't ""do not upgrade"", it's ""do not use at all"" (if you value privacy, security etc).   The thing about open source is that it makes the quality of the community irrelevant. The community could be a load of thieving bastards, yet it would not matter since you or anyone may inspect the code freely, at which point it doesn't matter who wrote it as long as it works for you."

"I question the integrity of entire open source community as they trying so hard and non-stop to influence people not to upgrade to the latest version of win 10 that immune to that ramsamware threat.  So we should install the spyware direct from Microsoft rather than rely on third-party suppliers, and also benefit from the cloud features of their ransomware, and we get protection from websites Microsoft doesn't like for free as an upcoming feature.  In other words, Microsoft building all the features of ransomware, spyware and other malware into their software, cutting down on the competition. Gotcha."

Another missed opportunity by Sony. Because when ripped from CD ACC files were better quality than .mp3.

MP5?

This has been established again and again through extensive tests by audio professionals with reference quality systems on just about every music production forum on the internet. I know for myself at least there's absolutely no way I can tell on my near field monitoring system or with any of my headphones, and I do a whole lot of critical listening on this system. Unless you've got an extremely high end system and golden ears better than the average mastering engineer, there's no way you're hearing a difference either. Do some blind tests with accurately level matched files if you really want to know.

Whatever they make, they turn around versions so frequently that within a short period of time you're already looking at it being obsolete and they quickly stop stocking spare parts too. They're throwaway tech. If you understand that and accept that they'll never quite work right then it is your money so go ahead. Personally, I prefer my stuff to last longer and work better."

A ""detail"" I guess, nothing really worth mentioning, for some reason https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehi_%28group%29 Lehi (Hebrew pronunciation: [ˈleχi]; Hebrew: לח""י – לוחמי חרות ישראל‎‎ Lohamei Herut Israel – Lehi, ""Fighters for the Freedom of Israel – Lehi""), often known pejoratively as the Stern Gang,[9][10][11][12] was a Zionist paramilitary organization founded by Avraham (""Yair"") Stern in Mandatory Palestine.[13][14] Its avowed aim was to evict the British authorities from Palestine by resort to force, allowing unrestricted immigration of Jews and the formation of a Jewish state, a ""new totalitarian Hebrew republic"".[15] It was initially called the National Military Organization in Israel,[1] upon being founded in August 1940, but was renamed Lehi one month later.[16] According to Jean E. Rosenfeld, the group admitted to have used ""terrorist"" attacks.[17][18] Lehi split from the Irgun militant group in 1940 in order to continue fighting the British during World War II. Lehi initially sought an alliance with Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, offering to fight alongside them against the British in return for the transfer of all Jews from Nazi-occupied Europe to Palestine.[2] Believing that Nazi Germany was a lesser enemy of the Jews than Britain, Lehi twice attempted to form an alliance with the Nazis.[2] During World War II, it declared that it would establish a Jewish state based upon ""nationalist and totalitarian principles"".[2][19] After Stern's death in 1942, the new leadership of Lehi began to move it towards support for Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union.[1] In 1944, Lehi officially declared its support for National Bolshevism.[6] It said that its National Bolshevism involved an amalgamation of left-wing and right-wing political elements – Stern said Lehi incorporated elements of both the left and the right[2] – however this change was unpopular and Lehi began to lose support as a result.[20] Lehi and the Irgun were jointly responsible for the massacre in Deir Yassin. Lehi assassinated Lord Moyne, British Minister Resident in the Middle East, and made many other attacks on the British in Palestine.[21] On 29 May 1948, the government of Israel, having inducted its activist members into the Israel Defense Forces, formally disbanded Lehi, though some of its members carried out one more terrorist act, the assassination of Folke Bernadotte some months later,[22] an act condemned by Bernadotte's replacement as mediator, Ralph Bunche.[23] After the assassination, the new Israeli government declared Lehi a terrorist organization, arresting and convicting some 200 members.[24] Just before the first Israeli elections,[24] a general amnesty to Lehi members was granted by the government, on 14 February 1949. In 1980, Israel instituted a military decoration, an ""award for activity in the struggle for the establishment of Israel"", the Lehi ribbon.[25] Former Lehi leader Yitzhak Shamir became Prime Minister of Israel in 1983."

"It's actually pretty good. I decided to check it out after hearing about it here. Right wingers like it, so I expected it to be right wing propaganda like conservapedia. So, I did some test searches. First thing I searched was communism. And, the page actually provided well-cited, politically unbiased information.  In political and social sciences, communism (from Latin communis, ""common, universal"")[1][2] is the social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money,[3][4] and the state.[5][6]  I was expecting, ""Communism is when the government owns everything and enslaves the people"" or some stupid shit like that."

do you have port 445 exposed to WAN?  The running theory is that it's spreading by SMB shares either locally or across the internet as an initial attack vector.

But unpatched internet facing servers with port 445 exposed would let WannaCrypt in and it would spread across the LAN from there.

"Do you realize you just called what I said bullshit and then went on to try to explain why it's true? Though I do agree that economics are a major problem for nuclear. I think we can't just bury our heads in the sand and pretend everything will be just amazing. In reality nuclear and the 'Pinto Memo' almost immediately go hand in hand.  The Pinto Memo refers to when Ford chose to knowingly release an unsafe vehicle, The Pinto, after calculating that they'd save more money by paying out the lawsuits for deaths/injuries than by installing an $11 fix on each Pinto to fix the problem. The company behind Fukushima has long since acknowledged that the disaster could have been entirely avoided by giving safety a higher priority, but economic and perception costs led them to defer safety concerns. They felt it was more profitable to run a less than optimally safe plant.  But again I'd emphasize that that's just one problem and even if its consequences are particularly severe it's probably one of the lesser problems since nuclear is, by and large, quite safe. At least until you start building thousands of them which would yield a proportional increase in the risk of malfunction. Just bulleting some of the other issues:  Radioactive waste Fuel dependent on other nations Potential weaponization particularly if we pursue breeder type systems Constant energy output (we use vastly more energy during the day than the night - if a country was to rely heavily on nuclear they'd either end up wasting massive amounts of energy or need to build major power-storing infrastructure to use the excess night-time energy to supplement the next high demand day-time cycle) Nonrenewable. Uranium is finite. It's cheap and widely available now due to low demand. Were this to change, the quantity of uranium could become an issue. Even more so if the handful of countries with massive quantities of it chose to manipulate their newfound position of power and pull an OPEC. That in turn could lease to further increases in the cost of production. Centralized. Centralized energy means during any incident, many go without power unless there are redundancies in place. Redundancies are expensive and, by definition, not immediately necessary. In other words they're not likely to be utilized."

"I understand it in principle, but the digitally driven dynamic nature of this change worries me.  With everything going digital, this kind of pricing could start appearing all over the place.  The single-price model is one of the foundations on which the middle class stands, because it enables increased consumption with increased income - many products must be priced low enough to be sold to the lower class.  With personally-targeted dynamic pricing instituted across an entire market, you'll see more money flow from the middle class to corporations for less products and services while they maintain the economies of scale by selling to the lower class for lower prices.  While it's only a strategy employed by a minority of companies, competition will take care of it, but if it is implemented across entire industries... let's just say that your money will lose buying power as you have more of it, guaranteeing a flatter standard of living vs income curve, and lowering the efficacy of the profit motive.  Kind of like the Marxist favorite, graduated income tax, except this time it's for everything you buy.  It's ironically the ultimate manifestation of the free market and the ultimate decoupling of cost of production from price, like the diamond industry.

"Agreed. And even for those that pay by card wirelessly (utilized for smaller transactions, forced by certain banks, but broke as fuck), you can get one of those faraday-wallets to prevent such usage by hackers."
"Yep. But there's this small company who provides wireless data extremely cheap. Its only $3.50/month for 500 MB of data with a roll-over limit of 20 GB. That may not sound like a lot, but it is when you don't use the wireless service very much in the first place. I only use it when I want to make a VOIP call or look something up while I'm out in public, and for that, it is perfect. You can actually use the service for free, but then you don't get roll-over. And besides, I like to support the little guy, with the hope that one day, they will be able to offer home Internet service at a decent price too instead of being sswallowed up by one of the major monopolies."

"Yes, a progressive tax rate was one of the 10 pillars in the Communist Manifesto.  I've been dealing with it my entire life, thank you.  That doesn't mean I believe that it's just in principle or helpful in its implementation. A society where progressive taxes are viewed as just is a society where others have the right to take more of your property the more prosperous and successful you manage to be."
"Yes, and the only reason they can get away with it is that their tax forms are ultimately enforced with a gun.  Fortunately, Uber doesn't have that ability, and hopefully the market will punish them for such an idea."
"It's a smart - nay, brilliant - move for Uber, but an ominous portent for society as a whole if the technique proliferates across many segments of the economy.  Taken to its logical conclusion, it will actually decrease efficacy of the profit motive by causing the value of money to decrease the more one person or entity accumulates.  That decrease in motivation could be disastrous for the economy and society in general.  Hopefully the market will moderate the impact this technology can have."

A month b4 the PI story broke, anon on /pol/ said that something big will happen in a month and when it happens, we should keep asking the question. He also said he is afraid we will stop or give up. Anyone sane will see he was really assasinated by someone very powerful. Even the police said (ill find he video) that it is a real mystery murder, meaning there is no evidence that points to why he was killed. Atm there is no proof (or it has already been -deleted-) but if Kim has what he says, this could bring the whole russian narrative down and potentially redpill a shitton of lefties."

"Net neutrality is idea that Internet service should be treated like a utility. Without it ISPs will be free to charge you more for different packages--preferentially slowing down or speeding up certain destinations. And if you don't like it you're already fucked, because most areas of the US have only one or two ISPs that collude with each other anyway. They've made municipal fiber illegal in most places too, so net neutrality is really the last line of defense against getting raped in the ass even harder by ISPs and the analytics companies they partner with. Imagine a world where Comcast throttles YouTube unless you pay for the entertainment package, and massive slows down VPNs unless you pay for the highest tier ""Mobile Data Warrior"" package."

"""Again with net neutrality. It's a fucking stupid idea because at its most basic you think that your porn stream should be treated exactly the same as an hl7 interface across a tunnel between my ER doc and primary care physician.""  The site you are typing in right now would not exist if it wasn't for net neutrality.  Your nearby hospital has business class isp, while we would have a household provider. An increased speed would be negligible. The reason why net neutrality is great is because it gives everyone easy access to become a part of the web, which is a huge reason why it grew so great and continues to grow.  Remember when Verison tried to throttle and shut down Netflix so they can make their in house movie services more competitive? Without net neutrality, the internet would become just like TV and the radio; only certain established groups would be able to contribute, and anything that is contributed would be 'safe' because it would be cost inhibitive to do otherwise. What is better, a new idea for a movie, or another remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? The internet has a low bar of entry, and thats why it is so much better than any other form of medium. The death of net neutrality is the death of the internet (as we know it.)"

Or VoIP traffic. Or large downloads. Or streaming. Or video conferencing. etc.
"You illustrate exactly what the article is talking about, people putting things unrelated to net neutrality under its umbrella. Net neutrality is about preventing carriers from giving special treatment to some websites, perhaps in exchange for payment, e.g. giving CNN full bandwidth, but throttling voat unless it pays them extra."
"Imagine, if you can even be bothered to fathom an opinion different from your own that didn't come out of Chicago boys thinking, Time Warner decides that every one of its customers gets   6000  premium news from CNN at no extra cost, if you want news from another site than you or that other site will have to pay in order to have access to those sites. Voat already falls under a lot of fuckwits definitions of both social media and news aggregator, its a direct competitor to CNN's websites, what is there to prevent Time Warner from decided it needs play gatekeeper to its millions of customers and ban Voat based on hatespeech unless Voat pays them for access or TimeWarner customers fork over more money to access ""unapproved"" websites? I'm also going to give you a dose of reality, this is not packet prioritization, this is not international or even national traffic throughput or reliablity at risk, big isps all have a direct line to big web services like YouTube, Google, Facebook, Netflix etc, they all have on network caching so that when Johnny Bumblefuck wants his 40th conservative episode of Cheers his traffic has not left his ISP's network. ISP's like Comcast and TimeWarner are not the fucking internet, they buy connectivity from companies like Level3 but they are cheap fucks unwilling to not only invest in their own networks and additional connectivity but also perfectly willing to enable a scenario where they the companies that own an awful lot of the worlds media can decide, just as a TV provider would, precisely who can have access to what. You know if your doctors internet craps out its your ISP's fault for over fucking selling its capacity right? They oversold what the doctors node / infrastructure could provide while relying on copper cabling that could be up to a mile long and spliced into hundreds of times over a two-three decade period while they refused to roll out the fiber network they were given a tax break to pay for.   but its socalism  No its not its called regulation, its all that stands between abusive practices designed to exploit monopoly sized market shares. Let me give you another dose of reality, the only reason the Obama FCC chairman put any effort into allowing netneutrality was so that Trumps FCC could take all of the flack for fucking over a whole lot of peoples internet services. It wasn't to be socialist, it wasn't to seize the networks for their own gain, it wasn't the first stage in Ministry of Truth style manipulation it was an objectively good thing put in place so that Trumps FCC (the same people as Obamas tbh) would get all the blame for doing what ISP's want.  but Johnny Bumblefuck isn't as important as an ER room!  Your average hospital is going to use a commercial service not a residential ISP, they'd also have their network traffic setup with priories and error checking in mind meaning what is high priority gets sent first and both ends of the data transfer can tell if the data was received intact or not. That commercial service would be a couple gbit per second fiber line not a couple hundred mbit, it would also be buying bandwidth directly off of actual connectivity providers like Level3 so Johnny Bumblefucks netflix shows using so many hundreds of GB of data doesn't fucking matter because its another ISP and Johnnys ISP has cached that data on its local network anyway meaning it never went though the same networks that the ER rooms data would ever go across. I mentioned commercial services, these would be fiber if its possible or sometimes its just very large very powerful microwave transmitters connecting the hospital site to a location where a fiber connection can be accessed so even if Johnny Bumblefuck lived next do and was also a mad torrent whore its not like it would effect the hospitals connection in anyway."
"Without net neutrality, the uber rich elites would control the internet instead of the government. Choose your poison."

Having a high class expensive hospital having great Internet and a low class poor hospital being cut off is a problem.   Without NN you'll have a rich asshole watching porn with privilege over important services that don't make money or don't have the right agenda so the monopoly of ISPs just decides they aren't worth it and fucks them over.           No net neutrality = oligopoly of shit corps like comcast, but now with the freedom to do what ever the fuck they want with supply, to manipulate and filter anything they want however they want."

Screen space, especially on app lists, is extremely limited. If you have to pick one of two very similar icons, you'll need to stop and think before tapping(disrupting your workflow). And, while some will create shortcuts to the apps at known points on their home screens even if they haven't prior, a good deal will remove one app or the other out of frustration with hitting the wrong one.

Chemical energy storage is better, Hydrogen, ammonia, carbonate, dehydration etc, and using excess power to produce products from CO2 such as simple hydrocarbons is another great choice.

"Another interesting possibility is lengthy ultra high voltage direct current lines. Using HVDC you can transmit electricity with about a 3.5% loss per 1000km.

"In many ways fields like law will be some of the easiest fields for automation to take over. Assimilating massive amounts of occasionally contradicting or ambiguous precedent and then applying that to produce a probabilistic result is more or less the high level definition of how deep learning systems work. In any case law will certainly be taken over before plumbing will. I think it's also narrow minded to suggest that productivity requires any sort of IQ. Not only is IQ somewhat farcical, but it only tends to relate to one form of intelligence in any case. And stating that half of people have a lower than average IQ is tautological. That's the definition of IQ. IQ is measured relatively with the median set to 100 with a standard deviation of 15 points. Even if every single person was literally Albert Einstein - half of people would have a lower than average IQ. The small variances in results, noise, would simply be amplified to create a normal distribution fitting the current standard model. In any case fields like art, music, entertainment certainly don't map against IQ. And the great thing about basic income is the massive potential for entrepreneurship. Imagine somebody is a decent hobbyist carpenter. He might make a few pieces here and there that he sells, but can't take the risk of trying to do it for a living. Basic income would almost entirely mitigate the risk and enable him to give this a go as a living. The basic income would also ensure that the amount necessary to be in the black would be minimized - enabling somebody who otherwise may be trapped in go-nowhere jobs to have a go of starting his own business. Wealth inequality is not a bad thing when there is economic mobility. Right now nearly everybody born poor in the US will die poor. And nearly everybody born rich will die rich. By contrast the countries with the greatest socioeconomic mobility are the countries that many in American consider socialist (they're not) : Denmark, Norway, Finland, etc. And it's not small scale mobility, Norway for instance has more billionaires per capita than the US. I think it's increasingly clear that a huge part of economic mobility is a safety net. The US strongly deters people from taking the risks necessary for success since the price of failure is so great. And we're increasingly loading everybody up with debt from day 1 ensuring years down the road when they might be interested in a business loan - nope, shouldda been born rich or not gone that fancy education."

Even if we push aside the obvious censorship aspects of this, simple fact of the matter is that companies want to own all of it (1).  What's ""it?""  Literally, everything.  They want to charge you for all content on pay-per-view on media, pay-per-day on software, renting all the equipment and most computerized devices in your home.  Unfortunately they're already doing that, and copyright law is how they're making it more iron clad, by basically forcing people to accept EULAs or have to deal with non-functional stuff. (1) Actually they want you to legally own stuff, since you pay for it to actually be built.  But they want complete and unfettered control over it, above and beyond your control, so that they can do as they wish with equipment that is theoretically and legally yours - and also, dictate what you can't do with it, like, I dunno, copy or access things they don't want you to."

You used to be able to profitably mine using consumer CPUs and then GPUs, and people that did that and held onto their bitcoins now have a lot of money."

"I don't get it. Engineering usually proceeds by building a new function on top of an old function that is already perfected. You cannot build a tall building on a weak foundation. For missile defense, that means the rocket engine aiming system has to work before the target tracking system. The math is easy. New designs have a very high failure rate. Suppose the enemy launch detectors have a 90% chance of failing because they are experimental. And so does the engine rocket engine aiming system. And so does the target tracking system. If you try to test them all at once, the probability of success is 0.1 * 0.1* 0.1 = 0.1%. You'd have to launch several thousand test missiles to get any feedback about what the problems are. Nobody can afford to launch 5000 missiles to perfect a new defense system. So instead you rig the machine so that everything is guaranteed to succeed except the one system you are currently working on. You only need a few dozen launches for each phase of development. This you can afford."

"They did mention railguns, but not the other two.  The next step is a rail gun. A rail gun uses electro-magnetic force to launch a solid projectile at extremely high speed and with great destructive force. The Navy would like a railgun to deliver projectiles at up to 200 miles from the launcher, with a circular error probability of five meters. Like the AGM, the rail gun could fire 6-10 times per minute, and unlike the AGM the projectiles would be inexpensive and easy to store. Considerable technical challenges remain, but a ship the size of USS Montana, with high energy production capacity, is a great bet to act as a platform for at least one rail gun. In the end, the USS Montana would have two railguns, capable of launching tungsten rods at targets 200 miles away, with the ability to wreak utter destruction based on kinetic energy alone."

"Not entirely sure what you mean here. Electric vehicles have substantially lower maintenance costs with next to no regular maintenance even necessary. The exact figure in cost is mostly cited as about a 33% savings. No moving parts except the motor is a big one. Kind of like in your computer how one of the first things to go is usually a hard disk. Moving parts stress systems, and combustion engines are full of numerous extremely high energy moving parts. Instant torque means electric engines don't even have transmission/gears."

You are welcome to blame your device manufacture as that is why you are having this issue. It was no different 10 years ago. They are not invested in keeping your devices up to date. They are invested in selling you an overpriced service on a overpriced device with poor support.
"Yeah, you like it up your ass too."
"Yup, already there, but it doesn't seem to be picking up the traction I thought it would."
"The invasiveness is, even though the first thing I did was click every off and no button I could find.  Not gonna help you.  Even people who pay thousands upon thousands of dollars for the Enterprise edition do not, in fact, get to turn off telemetry.  Never mind that this technically makes it illegal to operate Windows 10 in certain environments, nor the fact that Microsoft probably lied to these people to get them to buy the software in the first place and that might well constitute criminal fraud."
"I'm sticking with Windows 7, and if I have to I'll migrate to Linux.  I already run Linux boxes anyway, but the simple fact of the matter is that, contrary to Microsoft's attempts to sabotage any pre-Windows 10 operating system, Windows 7 is not going to burst into flame the instant Microsoft stops putting out patches.  Running decent security software, using a firewall, and not opening every attachment that some girl named MaryAnne that you've never heard of sends to your spam folder (whose messages always have a title relating to the size of your genitalia) works wonders, and considering what I've seen patches can do to a system, they are at best the lesser of two evils.  Truthfully, considering how patches are now an all-or-nothing proposition with Windows 7, I'd be surprised if many people still get them anyway.  Microsoft has probably crammed them full of spyware. EDIT: Actually the truth of the matter is that all things considered Microsoft's basically a malware manufacturer at this point, and they'd be considered such if it were almost anyone else.  So I'm not sure patches will actually do a thing to keep the bad guys out of your system, it'll just make sure they're from a relatively smaller subset of possible actors... at least until someone else manages to crack their update system or something similarly horrific."
"You say that, but I know people still running Win 3.1. I mean really. You claim security would be the thing forcing people to upgrade, but if security really was an issue for them they wouldn't be running a spy box in the first place."
"Lately I've been trying to transition to Mint Linux for my daily use needs, and just switch to Windows for gaming.  It's taken getting used to but I can see why Linux users like the CLI so much more."
"It was more that Microsoft jumped on the ball and got an update out for W10 right away, and left W7 unprotected till major organizations got hit and M$ was facing legal action so they decided to be gracious and give the update to W7."
"They skipped Windows 9 and went directly to Windows 10  They didn't skip Windows 9, they just renamed it to Windows 10.   Windows 10 kinda sucks, but it's still a step up from Vista a  7ff8  nd 8.  But it is still worse that Windows 7."
"That menu was available​ in Win8 too. Honestly, though, Win10 is so fast you can just hit Win and type whatever you're looking for - that's one of my favorite features (that also started in 8)"

"Having the preinstalled OS Jack's up the final price of the hardware.      The OEM volume discounts reduce the price quite a bit. They have a pretty slim margin and intense competition.     Why not just offer a computer with a blank HDD and let users havr the option to choose their OS of choice?     There are a few that do, but they're not very popular. Also, the shovelware people often collectively pay the OEM as much as the volume Windows license cost them."
"Not saying you're wrong, but I did read that with Dale Gribble's voice in my head."
I'm not super techie... But AFAIK there are community security patches for XP already made.
Windows 7 it will go the way of all other previous Windows versions. Zero day security exploits will become mainstream      I haven't given my Win 7 partition the wifi password for several months specifically because of the forced Win 10 upgrade. Isn't that a zero day exploit?

"For awhile I was taking the calls all the way to a human and than asking very politely to take me off their list. That did not work.  Recently, I started screaming into the phone at the top of my lungs as soon as a human picked up (I would literally hold my own ears shut and scream as loud as possible - kind of cathartic for me anyway).  That seems to have worked.  I haven't gotten a robo call in over a week now."
Yeah I just block non contact calls and just leave my voice mail open but if they allow this I'll just block my voice mail as well.
So sad
I'll call you for the right amount of bitcoin.  Hit me up.
"Me. You have tiers of people.  My folks, no cell phone only a landline and no answering machine/VM (ever). ""If it's important enough, they'll call back"" Me ~ I have an old flip phone and no landline, no texting, no apps (and $6/month bill using a $30 phone) ~ if you're not someone I've added as a contact, you have to leave a voice mail as I won't answer unknown numbers.    And then apparently there's a new tier who could do without any voice and subsist on text alone.    But there's a Vast swath of people ahead of whatever the 20 y/o kids generation is, who still use voice mail.  I have to say, that if this shit starts happening I will abruptly turn off voice mail and give Serious consideration to simply dropping the cell phone completely and be 100% without any phone connection."

"You're not wrong but a double edged sword cuts both ways. While they have an insane market position they still have to eventually cater their consumers. So if the vast majority of people stay with Windows 7 - as the case appears - then that's who they have to support. Whether they want to or not. The thing is that it isn't just your average consumer you're talking about  - a market that will likely move over to smart devices, anyway - but actual institutions that use it to get stuff done.  Sure they can bully you're average consumer all they want because where the fuck are they going to go? But when you're taking on other companies of equal or greater value to yourself who not only have actual market power but all the means to push back with litigation or fiscal manipulation then it seems obvious that that shit is not going to fly.  The fact that no matter how hard they pushed it it has still only gotten to a quarter of installs pretty much means it's a failure in my book."
That will likely be extended.
