"Build 1703 took away my ability to domain join computers from the Win+X > ""System"" shortcut.  Now it brings me to the Win10 style settings menu where I can change the computer name but not the domain.  I have to scroll down and click on ""system info"" to bring up the domain settings.  It's a useless double-jump.  Thank goodness Win+Pause still invokes the real System Properties screen.    They also took ""Control Panel"" out of the Win+X Menu in favor of the Win10 style settings menu.  I don't mind things being moved around and reorganized occasionally, but there are a handful of things the Win10 app-focused settings menu literally cannot do that the old control panel folders can."

"Are you sure about that? I hear it, but I've not seen anything official about it.  What they are doing is developing Windows 10 on ARM with Qualcomm, but they've stated that it is intended for ""cellular PCs"" which are laptops connected to cell networks running on ARM hardware for the energy efficiency. Further, they've essentially said that this tech will not be used on phones because something along the lines of phones need to feel different than a desktop (so much for ""unifying windows"")"
"How terrible, they updated some of their build in applications. MS does have a problem with not including all the features, but they do actually get around to adding them in most of the time. Which apps are you using that aren't adequate replacements for the old ones where the old applications are actually no longer available?"
"Well, they've been proclaiming how they're ""unifying the platform"" for years now. Seems like every time they get going they get halfway done and start on some other new way to do it. It wasn't until a few months ago that the lack of mobile builds started to get suspicious."
"Did you find the female me, the gay cop me, the video game me, or the website maintainer me?"

"Yeah no kidding. Rumors are rolling around that MS and Qualcomm are making a cellular laptop, so maybe won't need a phone 👌🏻"
"That's really cool, I'll definitely keep an eye on it. The thing is, though, that I'm not really concerned to the point where I need a house of steel. PureOS really hammers the ""we're secure and you're in control"" part, but ideally that's just a feature in the robust portfolio being showcased.  The beauty of mobile devices now is that they can do so much. A good OS should be focused on maximizing all qualities of a phone, not just filling the gaps left by competitors."

"The problem with orbital assets is they can easily be destroyed by the government, which effectively owns space. I'd prefer to create a Blockchain based DNS system for everything from domains to usernames and match it with an OTA mesh network delivery protocol that can use literally all wireless spectrums, from LTE, Bluetooth and Wifi to AM, FM, etc. Of course, the best delivery mechanism would be beam forming mm wave technology. This new, hybrid wireless mesh network, when coupled with high speed wired broadband over fiber, Ethernet and coaxial, would service the entire world. The benefits of the delivery mechanism replacing all existing radio technology are obvious, but the important thing about Blockchain DNS is that it takes the right to name things away from nations and turns it into a first come, first serve, market driven platform. The mining of a cryptocurrency used on this new internet would support its operation. All of that being said, it'd have to launch with it's own social networks and forums, it's own search engines, it's own encyclopedia and its own ecommerce platform. Which is why I'm building all of it. The delivery mechanism will take WAY longer and require tons of money. The rest of it is somewhere between 4% and 6% finished."

"I have used Cyanogen in the past, and I am vaguely aware of Lineage, but how easy is it to put on a modern phone? Seems like it's been getting more and more difficult to get a phone that will let you install custom OSs. Honestly, when it comes to phones I really don't know a lot about the underlying structure. Most of that is just that I've never really done it, but I had a hell of a time figuring out how to install Cyanogen even back when it was simple to root a phone."

"If AMD didn't have some sort of equivalent, they'd be at a major disadvantage in enterprise environments, especially those with a large number of locations. To skip straight to the TLDR, you'd either have to keep sufficient qualified personnel at every location, have quite a few floaters who have to go everywhere and perhaps leave helpdesk tickets unattended to for days or walk the user through every step. This sort of out-of-band management lets you perform most tasks you'd otherwise need to do in person remotely, neatly bypassing every issue(as well as that of having to have somebody find a mouse and keyboard for a computer that normally doesn't have either)."

"I completely agree. But I think the thing is, you do actually have skin in the game. We all do. Space, and very possibly SpaceX, represent the future of humanity. Exploration, resource utilization, colonizing other planets, and ultimately not just making humanity interplanetary - but making it a space fairing civilization. This is the next very obvious direction that humanity is heading in. ULA has had literally decades to do what SpaceX is doing. And they had all the funding in the world. For instance did you know that ULA gets a billion dollars a year for doing literally nothing? It's called a launch assurance subsidy and is designed to ensure that all of their operating costs are covered by the government, to ensure that the military always has a company to launch things for them. In reality it's completely unnecessary and just a result of corruption and cronyism. But now for ULA to be actively antagonistic and hurtful towards a company actually trying, with a threadbare budget, to change the space industry and world as we know it? Seriously, fuck those guys."

"I am in this camp as well.  It's a useless debate, the technologies are very complementary. I'm not sure VR->AR will ever work out that well though as cameras introduce latency and would reduce resolution of something you can get full for free. An AR headset that can fully obscure the real world on demand is where we are headed IMO. Then you can augment a door to a holodeck you can walk into and be in VR (in your AR capable headset) The state of the art AR headset (Hololense) has a field of view that has been described as postage stamp sized, so it's not surprising that people are having trouble grasping this concept yet."

As someone who loves America, but hates both major parties - I hated the idea of a Trump presidency, but fucking LOATHED the idea of Shrillary being in office.  I think a vast majority of the country are people similar to me. I care about our country and what we will become. Trump is making us a laughing stock with his childlike demeanor on Twitter, and seemingly throwing the betterment of the nation aside just to spite people who slight him. Not a presidential persona. However, I don't want anyone chosen by the DNC until they clean that shithole out... which definitely won't happen by 2020. But man, I don't know if 8 years of Trump will leave us in a good place."

You missed the whole point. They don't have backups. Which more than likely means that IBM on runs necessary weekly backups in case a drive fails.

"AlphaGo Zero has recently (like literally yesterday) been able to completely master the Chinese board game of Go in 3 days with NO PRIOR TRAINING, completely FROM SCRATCH. It discovered moves and strategies that have taken humanity thousands of years to develop and master. It then went on to discover completely novel and superior moves and strategies, and has beaten the best Go players in the world with a 100-0 win rate. It achieved this simply by playing Go against itself to learn how to play. This means that general AI is very close, and the techniques used to make AlphaGo Zero will be adapted to other tasks. Now imagine a generalized AI that can learn anything, simply by practicing (the way humans do) but can do in 3 days what takes all of humanity thousands of years to achieve.

"As far as that lawyer's advice goes, it's lacking.  He is right that an aggrieved customer should send a certified letter, but he's wrong with the inference that the customer then has to wait for ""month after month"" to go by before the customer can seek recourse.     The certified letter is a demand letter.  In said demand letter, the customer needs to provide a reasonable time frame for Frontier's response (this is usually defined by state statute, usually 10 or 30 days).  It is unwise to continue to wait and continue to get ripped off.  If the issue is not resolved by Frontier by the time frame the customer provides, the customer should then sue them in small claims court.  Sometimes with 'big' companies like these, speaking legaleese is the only way to get their attention."

I noticed that too. My no script would have something to say about that though.

"We don't need more laws, we need better parents. There's plenty of ways parents can use them with their kids constructively, and let them use it just for fun at other times. I always loved games, I'd kick the shit out of math and reading games at school back when they first became a thing, and I'd go home and play Mario and enjoy that too. Not every single thing has to be productive, but there definitely has to be a balance to it."
Why should be the law accountable for parents? We should not live in a police state. What parents need to understand is their morale obligations juries as parents to look after their own children and nurture them. Giving kids tablets and using for long period of time is just bad parenting.

Use it as a DIY smart TV, prototyping, etc. Or just use it as a portable computer that is MUCH cheaper than a laptop. Got a TV to borrow, get a bluetooth keyboard or something like that."

"Completely false. Multiple studies repeated multiple times over the decades indicate the only reason there is a shortage is because companies have refused to pay fair market wages. They then lie about applicants, then choosing to bring in illegal H1Bs. Many companies, including IBM, Oracle, Google, and Microsoft have all been caught in illegal collusion to suppress worker wages. The simple fact is, every single indicator is that worker wages have been illegally suppressed. So yes, expect wages to rise. Any other market reaction will be very unnatural and anti-capitalistic."
You're probably right. Someone else in the comments was talking about the temp agencies and how they are the worst. I remember setting up a new jc penney store my hockey coach managed when I was 15. He paid us $9 an hour but the older more skilled guys who were from the temp agencies got paid $14 an hour but walked with $8 after the temps cut. These guys ran forklifts and we got paid more for putting together furniture fixtures. Basically playing lego to get more than guys risking their lives hanging lights and stuff.

"See, this is one of those things where voat and I tend to disagree, but not entirely. On its own: the statement ""BUY AMERICAN, HIRE AMERICAN"" is great.  I absolutely encourage everyone to buy and hire whoever the fuck they choose. But a lot of you folks want the government to force others to do the same, or to inject force into the market to artificially bias the market in favor of (politically connected) American companies. We don't need to subsidize and tax everything in the world. You mother fuckers need more Ron Paul in your life."

"This is why I favor repealing the 16th amendment and going back to funding the federal government primarily through tariffs -- as the founding fathers intended and as was done successfully for nearly 2 centuries.  Suddenly in 1913 the rich decided we needed a Fed that was unaccountable to the US citizen and the federal government should be allowed to tax people directly.  And look at how well that has turned out.  Stock market crashes, endless debt, foreign governments owning our representatives, states are irrelevant, a Supreme Court that writes its own constitution.  Really great move."

Apple is also less secure. It's always the first to go down in every hacking contest. It's crazy to invest millions of dollars in switching to another OS that will be more expensive and less secure than Linux.

"Apple is just as bad as Microsoft.  Apple is better for privacy, worse for security.  Microsoft used to not be bad for privacy, but they have too much Google in their DNA now.    Apple is the only major commercial OS developer that's not building an empire on user data.  That sets them back in a lot of ways (Siri is not nearly as useful as Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa) but it's also a selling point.    I don't like Apple's inflated price points, lack of customization, and security lip service, but I do like to acknowledge their positioning on privacy."

Best case scenario, they will be slapped on the wrist with a fee. And pretty much any fee is small change for google, especially if it means they can make it back in the future.  You don't like google and youtube? Well, don't fucking use them. And tell your friends not to use them. All the money they make is made by the users - that means you.

One could easily argue discrimination based on political status if being a conservative were a protected class, like being homosexual.  Another point. Google in particular is embedded into the elementary school and colleges through their EDU program, and all of the social media companies had employees working within each political campaign. Their influence is broad and they receive government, i.e. taxpayer money, hence regulation is not out of the question."

"I love the cake shop analogy. Liberals make a cake shop treat all customers the same, his rights dont matter.  Google should be treated like the cake shop, all customers are the same, it cant pick and choose. If you bring this up to a liberal, they immediately say the cake shops were refusing service based on sexuality of its customers, while google doesnt. But the underlining fact is the cake shop decided who it would censor and who it wouldnt, therefore google/youtube/facebook censoring based on a loosely defined set of rules THEY interpret on a case to case basis is the same thing the cake shop did.  I love using liberal logic against them.  Especially when they call me a nazi. I calmy say im a nazi since i voted trump, fine sure whatever, but if im a nazi your a pedophile. Boy that gets them angry, and i explain liberal logic to them. If trump is hitler and I'm a nazi, then liberalism that pushes the normalization of pedophiles, makes them a pedophile by default. Usually i get reported, blocked, or ignored, but it makes them think"
"Dont forget the rules THEY interpret on a case to case basis.  The rules only apply to conservatives, and right leaning people. While blacks/moslems/jews can do the exact same thing and not be banned.  If they layed out a clearly defined set of rules FOR ALL, then it wouldnt be unfair. But they dont, and wont because the left would be censored and they cant have that, thats the message being pushed"
They are monopolies and are censoring based on bias.  They aren't monopolies in anyway shape or form. They're certainly the most popular but they aren't the only. The sensationalism is silly.

Do you include every one who would favor the existence of a few european ethnostates in that a people should always be able to have a land of their own? China, Japan, Israel, all are operational ethnostates.  Having a few for europeans would make white people a whole lot less jumpy with all this 'diversity' nonsense. Europeans are at risk of becoming minority populations in every country they've ever held, can you not imagine that risk resulting in serious amounts of violence? And in a worst case scenario, a genocide against the native european population in say, 40 years or so?"

It has video and images that aren't available in the archive. That said here's the archive link: http://archive.is/53cMP
"Ideally, I would want a phone which is as close to indestructible as physics will allow while still fitting in the change pocket of my jeans. Oh wait, we had that technology over a decade ago. And it costs less than $20"
I heard AMD is trying for 12 nm. That sounds more reasonable. I still say both could sit at 14 nm until they figured out how to do atomic scale manufacturing (atom by atom) instead of just trying normal shrinks (at this point that is the only option).
Robot citizens that would enslave humans
"No the problem here is the movie posters, media, magazines are already using fake pictures ...so the human eyes consuming this mass media becomes accustomed to processed 'photoshopped images' as normal...most famous iconic images are all processed by computer and digitally enhanced, we have not seen a series of real photographs in publications in many years and even back in the old days of National Geo, Time Mag and European photographs they were using techniques like 'airbrushing'...removing unwanted things in photos, sometimes Joe Stalin famously erasing entire people out of history."
"Seems like it would still be cheaper and easier to just use real people, plus keep the uncanny valley away from porn."

"For industrial stuff in particular I'd expect the entire goal is to completely remove the human from the picture as quickly as possible. It'll be pitched as human assistance to avoid backlash, but that's going to last about as long as just the tip. But beyond that there's a couple of other things:   Google discovered, unsurprisingly, that humans are pretty much useless when going from a disconnected state to being expected to be able to make decisions in a scenario where milliseconds matter. The whole idea was that humans would be able to be more comfortable and rested while maintaining situational awareness, but that's just not realistic.   It's not needed. Humans were mostly being used as a patch because of a problem with self driving cars. It's been relatively easy to get from 0 to 99%. But getting from that 99% to 99.999% where you'd really want them to be is taking an enormous amount of work. 'Let the human solve it' was just a lazy fix. There's no inherent issue with it - it will just take time and research, whereas companies would rather be selling the tech today, not a year from today."

Got any other ideas on how to prevent spam? Aside from those deployed by reddit and voat in combination with the captcha.
Easy answer to that is skip the useless article and go to the video. Where there are comments. Where it says 36:30. https://hooktube.com/watch?v=eELI2J-CpZg
You should use the /s tag. Young people see this shit and think it's what reasonable people actually believe.
"Because most won't check that link: Please stop upvoting this account's submissions since they're mostly (or all) for that VPN site. It is sort of a news source (a blog... really...?) but this is something a link to an EFF news on fighting for our rights would be more appropriate if it exists. While I cannot call an attempted privacy provider's blog spam itself (having information on our vanishing rights is quite important and a business being forced to comply with laws will have that information long before we will), I can say this user needs more than one posting source."
"I remember them too, along with MRAM. They have very limited/small scale MRAM production. I think they're still in the KB range."
Not a bit.

None
This is why i love science.  Can't do mental gymnastics when you're too busy crunching numbers.
"""Seems some people think everything is racist if it involves a black person.""  That's exactly what it is. The leftists believe that blacks are lesser creatures, who lack the capability to succeed on their own, therefore whitey MUST coddle them, even at great expense. It's the ""soft bigotry of low expectations"", and it allows them to live out their fantasies of being the ""white saviors"" (while the non-whites on the left clamor for their own victim points). It's a patronizing form of racism that, IMO is more harmful than overt hatred, as it lets them believe they really are the same. They see blacks as pets to be exploited for their own virtue signalling and sense of self-worth, then they call US racist for pointing it out."
millions of dollars of new age technology to tell us what our ancestors knew from basic common sense and experience.

They always overstate everything. It sells papers.
"It's not for law enforcement, it's for opposition control. Sooner or later people will realize how much of this countries wealth has been seized through schemes like the Federal Reserve. That is when this will come into play. Enjoy not being able to retire without living in poverty."
"The funny thing is that those ""educated"" liberal scientists knew that violent gene is real. Just being forced to fit the narrative or be labeled a bigot.  Fuck political correctness. The sooner we start discussing ""inconvenient"" facts instead of delusional censored narrative the sooner we can fix problems."
"It's not their fault because their gene is too divergent from the civilized races. So they do not have impulse control, violence inhibitor, empathy, long term planning, and capability of rational thought like what you expect. I blame the lying libtard scientist that classify niggers as homo sapiens instead of homo niggers."
"Why not find a way to make the stuff we need, cheaper..... but no. They keep building this shit instead"

"That's what many do, they upload them to Snapchat, Faceberg, etc. to raise their desirability and aid in the fervent search for strange dong they pursue. They have left behind traditional female roles and traded straight down for narcissistic marxist hypergamy. Word to the wise, don't make a ho a housewife."
Keep us updated. Voat him up so others can see.
True
"Likes, However,  pipilongstockings is going to keep us updated."
I shake my head at these investigations held by those being investigated.
"i know, its almost like they are google or facebook."
"yes, i totally agree with you"
and bitcoin ;)
Also requires blindly clicking links without realizing they point to file:// ...
Tor through a VPN has the potential of completely mitigating the protection Tor provides.
Windows then? if so you're entire OS is a virus.
im already compromised i cant be double compromised hahaha jokes on me im a tard.
not if the code is free of bugs
i wish the nsa would spy on me so at least someone would notice me.
Being an online thing wouldn't it effect anyone who uses it?
Yes. Some 135 (?) went to jail for the 2008 meltdown. Maddof springs to mind as another famous example.
they just have more competition than Google/Facebook/Twitter so they can't go full retard.
"Infosec here... not quite Browsers never used to resolve file links externally.  Thats a new OS browser feature, not a flaw in tor specifically. The problem is that the browsers have gotten ""smarter"" and they assume the file:// protocol to be a ""broken link"" (something that someone didn't mean to post as a URL).  So rather than just give up... the OS goes looking for the file.  This is actually quite handy in normal usage as people fucking suck at using computers and post broken links all the time. Edit:  Will have to figure out the exact method it uses to resolve the file:// protocol before I can definitely call it a browser or OS issue... but it's not a Tor issue."
womyn can do anything :*}
This is actually brilliant.
Indeed.  Oppressive media goons are surprised that their 'opponents' (formerly customers) are employing spy technology to avoid being spied upon.  Go figure.
"They used to be, but then the CEO got ousted and the swamp moved in (Eric Holder, Ariana Huffington, that fraudulent black lady with the African name who at one point was famous for working at Apple...)."
