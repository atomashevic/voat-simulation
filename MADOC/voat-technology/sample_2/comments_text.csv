"Ok, but what about the double-spend to mine and capture all that carbon, and then also to remove carbon expelled in exhaust? It's easy to write this off if you live in a clean-air part of America, but in Hong Kong, you can safely look at the sun with your naked eyes on most days, and the pollution meters peg out at their maximum readings fairly often.  This is likely a rather cost effective approach, especially if there are gains made in manufacturing this ink with traditional industrial processes."
Yup basically just libcucks getting mad that a platform allows for free speech.
Why is that funny? Maybe that's the reason they aren't leaching off the federal government like the red states and get their income from local sources.

"I'm sure it is that, but there will always be someone frothing at the mouth who doesn't understand that people are taking the piss and think they're among like minded people that are finally taking it seriously!"
mine too and people thought I was nuts.  I saw a thing a couple years ago of a guy that took apart his smart TV and along with the usual roku like streaming computer there was another computer collecting data.  I was even leery of connecting my PS3 but some games wont run without an update so it was kind of a necessity.
isn't it ironic to tell what people can post on a site that is supposed to be free speech? how about make yourself more useful by posting an archive link instead rather than just telling people that the site is corrupt?
"i use umatrix, i found that it's less likely for websites to detect adblocking software than using ublock origin or adblock plus"
"If you think it should be archived, then fucking archive it and shut up. Don't tell other people what to post, you sanctimonious little bitch."
"That may be why.  From the article: Intel indicated in a January 2017 revision of its Atom C2000 family documentation that the chip line contains a clock flaw. Errata note AVR.54, titled ""System May Experience Inability to Boot or May Cease Operation,"" explains that the Atom C2000 Low Pin Count bus clock outputs (LPC_CLKOUT0 and LPC_CLKOUT1) may stop functioning. Permanently. An Intel spokesperson in an email to The Register characterized the issue as ""a degradation of a circuit element under high use conditions at a rate higher than Intel’s quality goals after multiple years of service."" ""If the LPC clock(s) stop functioning the system will no longer be able to boot,"" Intel's documentation explains."
There will 99% be a major conflict in the next 15 years. I'm just doing my thing and sorting myself out. Training my mind and body to be ready if it does go down.
"...I think the point is that it's your browsing habits / patterns that make up a unique 'finger print' that may be identifiable - regardless of what IP or online identity you may be using.

"This would be the most likely culprit. Store it in RAM (however Malware Scanners can scan objects in Memory, obviously) and pass it to the Pagefile on shutdown - then load something in the bootloader perhaps to move and hide the file. Still, as you said - its a Reddit tier click bait title written by a nigger faggot."
It's all for free speech if you're a liberal following the herd.
"Arch has always been primarily focused on minimalism, its true, but minimalism in the sense of lack of bloat, NOT minimalism for minimal resource usage and therefore max compatibility. That paradigm is better addressed by OpenBSD, Damn Small Linux, linux from scratch, and, to a lesser extent, debian. Few machines need 32 bit support. Therefore it's bloat affecting the majority of the arch userbase. Someone will doubtless make a fork that keeps the legacy support."
"The idea is that those who want 32-bit Arch Linux will make it their own seperate thing, so it doesn't take up resources from the main project."

And as we all know, TOR is for terrorists, pizza and drugs, so you gotta be bad, amirite?"

"They had probable cause to think he did it and so they got a warrant to obtain cardiac activity data. Your medical data is already subject to properly-obtained search warrants, so what makes this unique?"
"Of course. Don't want to give up your data? Die!  Actually, the insurance company shouldn't own anything since they simply act as an agent to pool money to mitigate risk. You pay a risk premium to a company to pay out in the event you have a covered medical problem. Other premium payers share the risk. The insurance company does not own the capital they used to buy the equipment, they pooled it from other customers. The company earns a fee to manage the risk. That is all."

You can ask them to bring a certified lab report on your first date.
"FWIW, I'm sure that the classical ""tiny"" distros will continue to be available with IA32.  There are some out there that, though not particularly famous, have ""makes old computers useful"" as a very critical selling point.  Puppy Linux is one, IIRC.  I wouldn't be a bit surprised if someone forks Xubuntu for just this purpose, either, when Ubuntu decides to shut down 32-bit production. Simple fact of the matter is, though, that this is going to probably come to most Linux distros in the not-too-distant future, so dealing with it now is probably a good idea."
I just hope it's a while before 128-bit cpus become available.  It's very unlikely you will see them.  Moore's law looks like it running out of steam well before we have 65 bits of memory.  Even the original AMD 64 only wired up 48 bits of the address lines.  The few places that would benefit from 128 bits can be handled under the hood or through SIMD operators.

"Yeah, and not even having WebRTC is a big deal for Pale Moon use.  Also, as a side note, Pale Moon is no longer using Firefox as a base anymore."
"I'm calm, just disappointed that I can't browse Twitter any more without identifying myself."
"I am not aware of any which is why I said ""may"". My reason for including that at all is that Pale Moon is a non-tracking fork of Firefox which means that any issues found & fixed in Firefox must be independently fixed in Pale Moon. JJNova's comment about the lack WebRTC is valid. Firefox's default WebRTC settings are terrible. Edit: I have placed a rebuttal from Moonchild in the post."
Huh.  I wonder what's going on then.  Thanks for the info. Edit: possibly an IP address thing?  I get the same limitation using Tor.
Interesting idea. I assume I need a google account to get a throwaway number? Don't have one of those.

"For both security and privacy, Firefox is likely your best option. But with some adjustments most of the open source browsers in the list can be made to be both secure & privacy respecting. Beware that WebRTC is not privacy friendly so it should be disabled unless you need it. For Andrdroid, I would suggest either Firefox or Brave. I personally use Brave primarily because Firefox seems sluggish. However, Firefox is the only Android browser I know of that allows extensions. I don't know about iOS."
"Me too, it's the best firefox fork. Better than palemoon. Should be on this list."
I also use pale moon it's not the most convenient thing but it does what I need
Puh-lease.  IE?  ;)
Hopefully not.
"Since Firefox is the only one i know that supports add-ons on mobile version, i'll only list those:   CanvasBlocker - prevent canvas fingerprinting   CleanLinks - gives you clean links instead of e.g Google nested ones (so when you for example share a link it doesn't go through Google)   HTTPS Everywhere - tries to use HTTPS over HTTP   No resource URI leak - protection against fingerprinting via resource://   Privacy Settings - changes about:config privacy invading settings with one click   Self-Destructing cookies - oh well   uBlock Origin - block all those privacy and social media trackers (you have to check this in settings)"

"I didn't either when I first started using Tor. It's basically when I'm browsing privately, you might know who I am but you have no idea where my traffic is going but when I'm browsing anonymously, you might be able to see all my traffic but you have no idea who I am. Tor gives you anonymity but actually makes privacy potentially more difficult; the exit nodes can see everything you do (this of course does not apply to onion sites which do not use exit nodes)."
"I meet them at Fosdem, I guess this is the right place to share what I found there."
I completely agree with you and was initially going to include both IE and Edge but then realized if I did I ought also to include Safari (which I know almost nothing about) and an insane number of Windows or Linux only browsers. I would like to do that but don't have time right now.

Almost as many white south africans have been murdered every year since the end of apartheid as black americans were killed due to lynching in the century after the civil war. Where is the 'Strange Fruit' for that? How many people know that more people die in Russia each year from falling icicles than blacks were ever killed in a single year due to lynching? How many people know that there were several years after the civil war where as much as three times as many white people were killed by such methods?

"These aren't batteries in that sense, they're using molten silicon as a way to store heat energy which can be recovered later. There are many ways to store excess energy that don't rely on batteries. It is after all just energy."
"Wrong, there's plenty of lithium. Enough to supply our needs for about 7000 years as it happens, and you can also recycle it since it doesn't get used up like oil and gas. The cost of batteries has dropped 80% in the last seven years too and are closing in on the $100 per kWh which will make them cost equivalent to petrol, but that also ignores all the other costs of running a car as an EV is already cheaper in the long run than a petrol car over its lifetime. Cheaper batteries will just hasten the inevitable death of the ICEV and petrol stations are closing because they aren't profitable any more. Oil will never run out because we won't want to use it any more."

"Get Nmap. It doesn't really explain in depth what ports are used for, but it will show open ports and what services those ports are used for. If you were to scan an IP, for example, and discovered that a certain port was open, you could google it, look at what it is used for, and then scan the IP again to find out what kind of device you're looking at. Doing this a few times and coming across the same device with the same open ports helps build an idea of which ones are used for specific things. I believe Nmap also has a ""reason"" command that will try and find out exactly why the port is open. Of course, you could also check for open ports and then look at common known exploits for those ports. Learning how to take advantage of open ports will also give you an idea as to which ones should be closed."

Number of cycles possible.  And in this case, as it is a thermal battery, what is the energy loss from conversion of heat to electricity?.... that is an entire field of scientific and engineering research alone."
"Right now there are two types of transport companies:  Those working publicly towards full automation rendering nearly their entire workforce obsolete Those working privately towards full automation rendering nearly their entire workforce obsolete  It'd be negligent for any [large] company involved in transport to not be actively pursuing it. Other companies are and that means they're going to be able to offer rock bottom prices and in many cases clearly better service as well. For instance a human truck driver is only legally allowed to drive a certain number of hours per day. This won't be an issue with AI drivers. AI based trucking companies will be able to offer faster delivery for cheaper. It doesn't look great what they're doing, but what else could you expect them to do? At least they're being up front."

WebGL? I don't remember having suffered for having it disabled in the last 3 or 4 years. The biggest disruptor of sites for me is disabling Local Dom Storage.
It can speed up downloads from sites that only allow a certain bandwidth from each connection. Lets say youtube only allows 200Kbs from each conenction. If you downloaded that nronamlly youd get 200Kps but if you use for example Downthemall it will connect 20 times for 4Mbs or 200Kps times 20. Maybe not an issue from downloads in the same country but for overseas sites it shows its value. They also let you resume downloads more easily if they break where a browser you likely have to start again.

Then after I got sick of running out of space, I went to 'top tier' Chinese stuff, and didn't look back.  But I live in China so it's not like it's all that crazy, they have retail stores and support people all over.

"This is not limited to WebGL. I suggest people read the paper. Here's the PDF Snippets:  Now let us talk about browser fingerprinting works. Mow- ery et al. [32] are probably one of the very early works in proposing canvas-based fingerprinting. Some other works [31, 33] focus on fingerprinting browser JavaScript engine. Nakibly et al. [34], a position paper, propose several hardware-based tracking including microphone, motion sensor and GPU. Their GPU tracking only includes timing-based features, less reli- able than the technique in the paper. Laperdrix et al. [26], i.e., AmIUnique, perform a most extensive study on browser fingerprinting with 17 attributes and we have compared with them throughout our paper. Boda et al. [14] attempts to achieve cross-browser tracking, but their features are old ones from single-browser tracking including IP address. As discussed, IP addresses are unreliable when a machine is using a DHCP, behind a NAT, or moved to a new location like a laptop. ... .. In conclusion, we have proposed a novel browser finger- printing that can identify not only users behind one browser but also these that use different browsers on the same machine. Our approach adopts OS and hardware levels features including graphic cards exposed by WebGL, audio stack by Audio- Context, and CPU by hardwareConcurrency."

"For anybody that doesn't want to rely on third-party software for saving non-flash web video files:   Often you can just right click the video and save.    In Firefox based browsers you can go to about:config settings and change the setting 'media.mediasource.enabled' to false, then File > Save Page As > Web Page, complete(The video file will be in the web page folder you saved), or just find the video file in the browser cache folder in your file system(I found this method somewhat unreliable for big video files for some reason, the video files were broken into many different files).    You can right click a web page then View Page Source and often find the .mp4/video file URL with Ctrl+F  in the source code of the page. Copy the video url and then save it with one of the aforementioned methods."

"Actually I suppose there is one valid reason for publishing something like this. It is a good warning against providing AI any option including violence or direct harm. It's not so much that they'll go crazy and turn Terminator on everybody, but rather that as humans we can't necessarily solve scenarios as efficiently as AI can. In my roshambo game, or Google's Apple Picker game, it's clear that the actual solution involves violence. But what if we create more elaborate, and real, scenarios? Imagine for instance we create an AI to patrol the streets of a dangerous area. It was intended mostly as a surveillance system but was provided lethal countermeasures to be used only in the case of saving more lives than would be lost in its usage. So for instance killing one person to save 2. This doesn't seem like that terrible an idea at first. But now imagine through some calculation it determines most murders are committed by persons of a certain profile and killing every single person that fits this profile would result in a net decrease in the total loss of life. Suddenly the bot starts seemingly arbitrarily murdering people in a discriminatory fashion. This is a very plausible scenario and a great argument against ever providing lethal options to AIs. Perhaps the idea of more 'toy game' like scenarios is to make things more graspable for laymen which would include our political representatives and military leadership."
"Besides what @Caesarkid1 mentioned, a large part of it is actually being able to build a neural net of sufficient size without the thing needing terawatts of electricity. Computers have gotten a hell of a lot faster over the past decade, and compared to what they were in the optimistic, halcyon days of early AI research they're... well there really isn't a comparison. Compare a 1925 Packard with a Dodge Viper."

"He's also:   Envisioned bringing electric cars to the mainstream as a means of moving away from fossil fuels. At the time electric cars were glorified go karts for bay area hipsters to virtue signal each other with. Now pure electric vehicles are supercars - the Model S is literally the quickest production car made, on the planet.   Envisioned automated vehicles driving people around. At the time there was little more than some private tests from Google in the field. Now Teslas have driven hundreds of millions of miles in autopilot mode. And even though it's still a work in progress, the time in autopilot mode already has the vehicles with a substantially lower crash rate than when humans are driving.   Envisioned reusable rockets and bringing the cost of space launches way down to further pursuits in that domain. He succesfully created, launched, and recovered the first completely autonomous reusable orbital rocket - and then did it again, and again, and again, and again, and... The recovered rockets have already been tested and the first ""flight proven"" rocket launch has already been setup and will happen later this year, with a commercial orbital payload.   Envisioned bringing AI into the public domain ensuring such technologies can benefit everybody instead of just the huge corporations and governments that would have the resources to actively develop them themselves. The result of this is OpenAI which is a completely not-for-profit startup seeded with more than a billion dollars engaged in cutting edge AI research all in the public domain.   And much more...   Things he envisions have a way of going from sounding insane to becoming true. You'd really be fairly hard pressed to nail down any of his predictions or goals over the years that have not come to fruition in at least some way. I think the typical way people try to hate on him is to be upset that he hasn't refused the various preexisting tax benfefits for his companies - even though very little of it actually goes to his companies (most are consumer tax benefits) and his competitors in the same industries have, almost invariably, received exponentially more than he has at times in literal handouts as in the auto industry bailout."

"Do you actually understand that the ""best way"" to limit crime is to simply kill the criminal after X number of arrests?   Something like 70% of crime is repeat offenders, the majority have multiple arrests, at some point the chance they'll reoffend is close to 100%, so if you just kill them you will definitely reduce crime. We don't do it because of how it makes us feel, as in, most of us feel it's morally wrong to take that course of action and have helped make laws and policies against it.    There's no way to be even reasonably sure that a law enforcement AI with the ability to make life and death decisions would choose the same path we have after gaining experience, or would instead take the course of action that will guarantee a reduction in crime, there's simply too many variables."

"Not really their direct goal but like most companies they want to lower costs. Many do this by cutting workforce, Uber needs the number of vehicles on the road so the option is to reduce the cost of those vehicles in this case they are cutting the part that charges them per mile the driver the other options would be to reduce what they pay the driver or raise the rate. It remains to be seen how this will work out in the long run, as they are betting the upfront cost of vehicles will be less then the long term cost of the drivers. I can only think of the number of tables with gum stuck under them as a standard of how people treat the temporary places they sit. What will these cars without a driver in them look like after 6 months of operation?"

"So much this. Bulldozer benchmarked well and was garbage. The last round of video cards out of AMD benchmarked okay and sucked power at a rate so far out of spec it toasted motherboards. I want to believe, I truly do, but I'm holding my breath until they're out. Thunderbird was a great era in CPUs. AMD had the upper hand, made some money, handed Intel some comeuppance, and put a huge dent in the price of a CPU since Intel lost their brand premium pricing. Since then, prices have been continuing to creep up again....I'd love to see them get knocked down again."

As a long distance shooter there's more to the .50 BMG than range or taking a life. The primary tactical advantage you would get from one of these is stopping a vehicle in a 200 yard range. You really don't need a 2 mile shooting range in the middle of nowhere Wyoming to get the benefits of such a rifle. As is you would most likely use it to kill an engine of a fleeing suspect. Although it's a pretty silly scenario for the police to find themselves in.

"I disagree. I've had a Surface Pro 4 for a year now, and it's the worst laptop/PC I've ever owned. I think the main downside is Windows 10, which for me doesn't even work half the time. Any updates available? Let's break the keyboard or WiFi until you reboot to install them. In the middle of a Word document, but an important ""security"" update just came out? Lmao... let's reboot immediately and install updates without give you the option to defer, or even letting you save the document. Aside from Windows 10, I think the Surface Pro 4 is just built poorly. The entire back and sides are cheap plastic. The i5 mobile processor is laggy. It's overheated on me several times. For a $1500 PC I'd expect a premium product... It has so much potential. It could be so much better! But, in my opinion, it just falls short on too many fronts to be worth dropping the cash on. I'd rather put $1500 into a MacBook Air and slap Windows 7 on it... Not a huge fan of OS X, but Apple does have the hardware part down."

Forward thinking entrepreneurs will flock to Nebraska if this bill becomes law. It will be a great testbed for proving Apple is not harmed by allowing consumers to have their devices repaired by 3rd parties. Apple and other companies are afraid of bills like this because they will lose their monopoly on repair services and also see consumers sticking with devices longer because they no longer need to replace them as the only option when they break. I hope Nebraska and other states bring this victory for consumers to light.

"Well you only need physical access to the system once, rather than on an ongoing basis, so it's still useful. Imagine you get in as an air conditioning tech (say) using social engineering and you mange to infect a server room computer. You then don't need to penetrate the actual server room again."
"An airgapped system in this context is one that is intentionally not connected to any network. In most cases, no networking hardware is present, so the only way to get data onto and off of the system is via physical access. Which makes attacks by anyone but an insider virtually impossible, and data exfiltration without regular physical contact to collect the data pretty damn hard. This is just a proof of concept for making that last part easier."

"Fake news!?  Don't abuse that term like ""literally"" was abused. HDD controllers are micro computers at this point.  Enterprise disks even carry built in utilities for crypto and unattended formatting.  WIth that kind of space, something creative could be easily drummed up. Hell here's one:  Whatever body the US has that intercepts shipments, does so, and bugs an external HDD,  the disk now has the custom firmware. Drive is connected, and gets data put on it by the user. When disk is idle, the firmware begins reading the disk, from start to end, broadcasting each bit, and essentially giving a full disk image, albeit slow as tits.    Camera in room of secure hardware is tapped or accessed by a planted security guard, footage exfiltrated, data reassembled.  Full compromise Highly impractical - But entirely possible.  If someone, or some alphabet agency wanted to explore all options to get something, this is a very realistic alley to do so.  Especially if they can get another device in which can read at full speed and relay it out of room to another receiver."
What if it's a headless server? Or there's a privacy shield on the  monitor. Both are very possible for a system important enough to be airgapped
"While some HDD's do in fact have LED's on them, I'm very sure they were referring to the HDD lead from the mobo pin-out to the PC case. While I would not call this ""fake news"", I would call this ""old news"". Anything that can be off, then back on in a controllable manner can send data... HDD LED's, fans, KB, optical mice, speakers, screens, a desktop icon, all of it. The reason I would call this old news. you only need on and off and in reality, I would think you don't even need full ""off.. just a small change, a flicker could do it... now lets talk about how that flickering red light you saw in traffic today was really programing your dash camera to listen in on you lol. Sounds like a joke... and it is... for now. :)"
"To be fair, its talking about it being precise enough to transfer data at a reasonable bandwidth, and it being possible to hijack it via software. But effectively, yes."
And collect the data how?
"Yeah, exfiltrating data is the easy part of compromising airgapped systems, the hardest is getting your code on in the first place, and sending commands to it"
Or put a piece of electrical tape over the LED.

"I beleive you are right, I heard of many other people having the same issue with their android phones."
"So, looking at this information, the recall is ONLY of the battery pack, you would send it in, and get a replacement battery that has been deemed safe. Since I ASSUME the warranty provided with the computer at sale likely has a provision for component recalls (every electronics warranty i've ever read does), even if you are still within that warranty period, the manufacturers warranty would doubtless preclude you from using this as grounds to request a replacement or refund of the entire unit. That simply leaves the implied warranty of merchantability; that is to say that, when you buy a product that's not listed as being sold ""As Is,"" the mere fact that it is being sold would imply that, for the most part the machine works, and is built to a standard where it should stand up to routine use for a reasonable amount of time without failure. This does not protect against minor issues or defects. An example often cited would be that of a refrigerator. If the refrigerator cannot keep itself at constant, cool temperature, that's a serious defect, as it makes using the product for it's primary purpose impossible, or at least substantially burdens that function. If instead, the refrigerator can keep itself cool, but the drawers inside have a tendency to stick shut thanks to a hanging bit of material, that is NOT a problem that would be considered a defect under the implied warranty, as for the most part the product works, and can be used as you would expect. This battery safety issue likely falls under the category of a minor defect. Additionally, as the manufacturer has provided a resolution to the problem, you would be hard pressed to argue you deserve a full system replacement or a refund. TL;DR Unless you can demonstrate that this particular defect substantially impacted your ability to use the device in a normal manner from time of purchase onward, its unlikely that you will be able to turn this into a refund or a brand new machine. What you WILL be able to get is a replacement battery that is not defective, in exchange for your old battery, provided your old battery is identified as being from the batch that is dangerous. If your battery is NOT from that batch, you don't have a defective product at all (at least according to toshiba at the moment. Its possible that they might expand the recall later). You should be able to get this replacement in a manner that does not incur significant costs for you; IE, toshiba should pay shipping to you, and should require shipping costs of no more than the cost of a new battery to ship it back to them. In practice, they will almost certainly pay shipping both ways, especially since this is a safety issue; Toshiba would not want the liability of a customer being injured after they could not afford to get a replacement for a product that was known to be dangerously defective. TL;DR TL;DR You won't get a new computer, but you should be able to get a new battery for free if yours suffers from this defect"
"Bug or not, this type of ‘feature’ may not sit well with those who have purchased the product expecting a high-level of privacy.  Looks like one reporter did not read the EULA. I'd like to know who thinks it is a good idea to have all of these connected devices and have them controlled by one or two companies (depending on which spying brand you chose to buy into). It's not a good idea to give other parties control over critical infrastructure, since it opens the door for future censorship or policing of ""thought crimes""."

Sure, it works for the guy who needs to make a table to organize their life once in a while, but excel just can't be beat for actual number crunching."

"I provide an archive of every post I submit. I have no problems with any of the domains I post, but provide the archive in case someone else does. Also in case the story gets nuked."
"No, it cannot. There are two basic types of connections in networks. Client-server and peer-to-peer. Voat is an example of client server. You connect to a server and that server in turn delivers all your content to you. It's a single point of failure. If the company that hosts Voat decided they don't want to tomorrow then everything would be lost until the site could be moved to a new server and the process repeats. Peer to peer is the other way. Torrents are (mostly) peer to peer. Instead of one server delivering all the content peers connect to each other and share content. Shutting down one peer doesn't do anything at all in terms of the availability of content. In light of all the recent attacks on the internet ranging from censorship to increasingly invasive copyright measures many folks, including the scientists behind the original development of the internet, are starting to push for more decentralized and peer-to-peer type internet. The main reason this wasn't how things started is that client-server is just a whole lot easier. But outside of the initial technical implementations, peer to peer is vastly superior in just about every way. For instance it naturally scales. Think about client-server systems. When Voat saw massive growth the site began breaking simply because the server couldn't take it. But now think about a torrented file that's very popular. Lots of people torrent it but that means lots of people are also sharing it and so there's absolutely 0 impact on its availability. If anything as sites grow in a peer-to-peer environment they tend to become more reliable. Peer to peer networks are impossible to shut down. Even if you killed off the internet as we know it (by, for instance disabling all ISPs), peer to peer networks would be able to rapidly and seamlessly migrate to begin developing a new internet using any sort of available and shared network capacity - such as wireless connections."

So I turned it all off and called Apple. They don't even know how their iCloud works.  Ie, was data there, then deleted when I turned it off, did it never end up there? Etc? Useless shits. They're all for forcing default on with this shit now.  Once upon a time I trusted notes and calendar data were safe but now there is a risk of leaks into the digital ether just like texts, calls and internet stuff, the whole usefulness of a mobile phone is gone again now.

"Its easy to explain if you use the ""do you trust your bank?"" example.  Question: Do you trust your bank?  Answer: Yes and no. (probably, idk who you'd ask this question to) Question: Why don't you completely trust your bank? Answer: I think they look after themselves first. Question: but doesn't your bank handle all your cash less transactions (through a proxy), why would you only partially trust them and still use them? Answer: yeah but thats just for convenience and stuff, I don't want to have to go to the ATM and withdraw cash just to buy everything. Question: What if your bank does not trust you, makes you call them and answer questions for every purchase and if your answers are not satisfactory you can't buy what you want to buy. Then what happens? Answer: They'd never do that, thats just so inconvenient and awkward. Question: So why do you trust a media conglomerate to have direct access to your software, potentially your hardware, and an awful lot of your browser data? Answer: What? Statement: DRM is a phone home service, every time your browser access something that is DRM protected, perfectly innocuous stuff can have DRM, it phones home with who knows what kind in of info. Why would you trust a media company to act fair towards you with anything you do while browsing the internet?

"I think there's a difference between sober skepticism and something bordering on denial. At this point we can look at vehicular automation, just by itself, as something that will be imminently completely upsetting our jobs system. This isn't pie in the sky futurism. You can buy cars that are completely capable of driving themselves. And in Tesla the crash rate among vehicles when in auto-driving mode is already a fraction of that when humans are driving the vehicles. Uber is already testing completely automated taxis. They still have humans in the car or this wouldn't be called a test, but this isn't like ""Oh maybe 5, 10, 20 years down the line this might happen."" The technology has already happened. What we're in now is the refinement phase before it's commercially released. And again that's just one form of automation among countless others, but it's one that will single handedly completely wreck our jobs system. Your comment would be like if we already had numerous stations on the moon with dozens of people at each testing them out to ensure their safety and stability, and you were claiming that colonies on the moon were a distant future fantasy."

"Many of the loudest voices warning about and trying to prepare society for a smoother introduction of AI are the people behind the system who would have been poised to become kings in an ill prepared society. For instance Elon Musk been speaking and acting on the issue constantly having done things like helped to start OpenAI which is a billion dollar completely not-for-profit organizations whose sole purpose is to ensure AI research is in the public domain and used for the public good instead of remaining relegated to corporations and governments. I think the rise in visibility is largely just people becoming more aware of the tech and where it's headed. That does kind of go with what you're saying but the implications are different. It's not out of personal concern, but social concern - people beginning to realize the world we all grew up in is headed towards revolutionary change that it's really not particularly well prepared for."

Unless it's going to talk over a station I'm already listening to I'm not going to tune into a poster's frequency.  If it does talk over a station I'm going to rip that poster down.

"This would be a negative if it wasn't for the fact that macOS and iOS are both based on the same underlying operating system. There's no reason to have a dedicated Mac operating system team because they're all working on the same code base, Darwin. There will be sub groups built around the different UIs running on top of the base OS of course. It makes much more sense from a software development point of view to have developers ensuring that their code runs on all the various bits of hardware rather than each team forking it constantly."

You can just do more for the price with a PC though. Mac stuff is just too marked up for what it is to justify the cost just to get access to their software platform. For what Apple would sell a locked I5 cpu with 8 gigs of ram and no GPU you could build a unlocked I7 with twice the ram and a video card to work with. Dual booting Windows 8.1 with Linux isn't the end of the world either. There's also some crazy hackintosh builds out there that put Apple's offerings to shame.

"The law treats bicycles as vehicles when it comes to traffic law. In most places. They are not constrained to streets with bike lanes. Given the tendency for people passing to aggressively pass as close as possible (and passing a vehicle in the same lane is illegal anyway), it is often safer to ride in the middle, as is the bicyclist's right. They dont have to demand to be treated as cars. Thats what the law says. Maybe youre the lawless one."
"They have decided that their method to monitor those that think they are anonymous (not just the pedos that use TOR)... Is more important than punishing someone for a particularly horrid crime.

"As an AMD fanboy, no. It doesn't have good overclocking potential. Best you can get with water cooling is 4.1-4.2. When I get one I'm not going to overclock it."
"No one is going to know for a while. They hit 5.8ghz on LN2. The previous record was 5.2ghz. To reach 5.2ghz, they only used the multiplier to overclock. To reach 5.8ghz, they used the base clock and the multiplier. There is a lot of things people will have to learn about this platform and CPU before we get any sort of proper overclocking results.  For now, you can basically raise voltage to maximum safe 24/7 voltage (1.4v) and raise the multiplier. People will figure out more as time goes on, when Piledriver FX CPUs launch, people found all sorts of weird quirks that let them get better overclocks. You can expect about 4ghz right now if you just raise the voltage and the multiplier, but I am pretty confident people will find out better ways to overclock. One important thing is to make sure the motherboard supports base clock overclocking if you're going to get a Ryzen. Base clock and multiplier overclocks almost always gives better overclocks than just with the multiplier, and oddly enough base clock overclocking is better because it overclocks a lot more of the chip. You just need to make sure you get a motherboard that supports base clock overclocking, they decouple the PCIe clock generator from the base clock. If you overclock your PCIe, you'll corrupt data and cause a ton of problems. Not all AM4 motherboards do it, I know the ASRocks with Hyper bclck II do (it's what I'm getting if backorders ever get filled)."

I suspect these exploits and tools are what they use once the target has been hacked.  The details of how the initial hacks occur will probably be revealed later.  Wikileaks is releasing this stuff in batches similar to the Podesta/DNC leaks.  The dirtiest details came later in those cases.

Windows doesn't have that going for it although they're shoehorning the Ubuntu personality in there but it is still nasty because the CTRL-C combination is mapped to copy on Windows which is irritating.

Applications should also stop hunting around various places for DLLs they need and only load them from the specific folder they are expected to be in.  A lot of the time you can just drop a DLL into an application's install folder and if it has the right name, that's the one that'll get loaded."

"To be fair, many new battery announcements are ignored because of serious flaws in the battery cell, whereas this report is pretty exhaustive and it seems like a straight upgrade over lithium ion (though I note the cost is not announced, but seeing as lithium is hella expensive, it seems likely that it could be mass produced cheaper than Lithium Ions), and VERY frequently because media reports on it WAY before it would be ready for market. For instance with this report, the annode is done, the cathode isn't. So the source is reporting on technology that is quite literally half baked. Battery tech takes time, and some sources don't realize how many things have to be considered. A common thing I hear is ""This tech will charge an electric cars battery in 5 minutes, isn't this amazing?"" No, and you know why it won't reach market? Because its being charged off a current source far beyond what someone outside a lab can easily provide, and its charging curve isn't nearly as good when on your standard consumer house circuit."

"You bring up an interesting point that's been on my mind lately. When I picture civilizations of the future, technological advancement always plays a huge, inextricable role in the paradigms and infrastructures that shape those societies. In many ways technology's provided mankind with the means to introduce multiple layers of abstraction and convenience between people and basic survival, giving them the time and physical health to pursue other activities, but also diminishing their basic survival skills because they never needed to learn them in the first place.  So while on one hand those layers of abstraction have made it so that people have more free time to pursue other subjects and activities, on the other hand the more layers of abstraction a society begins to develop the more fucked they are if that technology fails because its citizens will be incompetent without their machines. So what does that say about a future that's heavily influenced by technology? That it's necessarily going to involve a population that would be fucked if shit hit the fan and they couldn't rely on that technology anymore? I see the direction the world's going now and it seems inevitable that we're going to continue mindlessly piling on the layers of abstraction without any plan or vision behind it, and that eventually some major event (or combination of them) is going to fuck us over because we were too short-sighted to prepare for it."

They gave them the keys to block the NSA/CIA hacking.  They exposed the exact programs that they are running.  Just wait, the new trend will be ""NSA FREE"" electronics."
