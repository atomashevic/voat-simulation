5 minute ads should be a crime.
Well
"You have to be a computer-retard  Most people are.... that's why they use their mobile phones, but can't block ads because youtube is a walled-garden app. I can't wait until people start seeing mobile using with the same contempt as me — they're the most vulnerable to propaganda, but they're too busy being instantly gratified to understand why."
"I am a terrible person, but also watch a ton of youtube alt channels and cant stand commercials, so I started the yt red bit. Turns out, according to some of the ones I watch, they are making mor emoney from me now they are getting blocked than grom the advertisers. Yes, I hate google as much as everyone else. I fail in being lazy though, started the shit over a year ago, and am too lazy to discontinue..."
How the fuck do I use it? I remember installing it and having no clue what to do next. Hint: if your WWW replacement needs a tutorial then it's shit and not worth considering. There's TOR if I absolutely need anonymity.
"Most of these personalities are critical of the shit MSM pushes, and some have more (journalistic) integrity than those assholes whose livelihood depends on staying on the narrative. Plus they convey those ideas faster and in more bite-size entertaining ways."
How low would minimum wage need to be for the humans to be competitive with these robots?

"Yeah it most likely will be spectacular, similar to when a plane crashes hard and 200+ people die. What ultimately matters is cold hard data about whether it's safer than alternate forms of transportation. The situation is similar with planes, when they crash it's always a big deal but statistically driving a car is more likely to lead to your death or injury. Only time will tell, but since the hyperloop doesn't have to share it's route at all or even partially like trains do, most likely it will be very very safe."
Walled garden + high level of understanding needed to use high-tech stuff = profit?
"I disagree withe flying cards and space corridors.  Even if it is realized by 2050, it wont be common or wide spread.    A new race of bioengineering people.... same deal, it might have started, but not in any significant numbers           traditional family and religions replaced by the new age ? not sure what you mean there...... religion is not easily displaced.     I don't think home robots will be all that common (but will have taken over most of industry and a sizable chunk of commercial work), but poorly designed and vulnerable integrated IoT will be absolutely everywhere."
"lol, thats awesome"
"Silent, but deadly!"
sigh
"The problem within the open source community is just that. Every time something fucks up, the project gets forked and thats it. But it never addresses the issue of confrontation. The SJW keep the main project ""alive"", the fork gets more commits against it and voila. But the SJW thinks they won, and the project fork becomes the new ""master"". The same strategy is used in very big corps too, the department is rebranded, but the issue is never ever resolved because no one bothered to talk to the retards and tell them to STFU. It really doesnt help that the SJW ""logic"" is based off ideas that are not tangible or in any way measurable(Probably intentional)"
Chill out dude. Your just jealous your not a student.
"If that was from mythbusters, the rail car that imploded had to take a significant hit to DENT the steel before the vacuum implosion thing worked. Before that it did not matter that the rail car was set for decommissioning and very covered in rust and the safety features were removed. Seriously, an inch or two of steel is enough to keep a vacuum from collapsing the shell. This is the principle for our space vehicles and submarines."
"I have no issue with seeing ads when I deal with free content, the problem is when the ads exceed the content. Many sites have more ad space then text in articles, and yes I count the ads for their own stuff as ads. for me My limit is about 1/10th ad, for a 30 minute video that means you get one 3 minute chunk of ad time, or for many of you ~8 minutes videos all over youtube you get 45 seconds, watching a 3 minute music video you get 18 seconds. any more then that and I'm skipping out on the whole thing, I will not sit through 15-20 minutes of ads mixed into 45 minutes of content like on TV, at that point I would rather pay for the service then waste my time watching the ads. Basically my issue isn't that I refuse to see ads but that I refuse to give up 1/4 of my time, or 2/3 of my reading space to them my tolerance for ads has dropped. Especially in any media that I have to pay for as well, so cable or satellite that charges X amount and then wants 1/4 of my time for ads is completely unacceptable to me."
"hope Brave crushes Firefox.  I thought the same thing like a year ago... truth is, it's just not that great."
"I would be cautiously pesimistic about this, if not outright laughing.  Check out Thunderf00t and hyperloop.  Stupid idea."
"Yeah this smacks of bullshit, computers do not transmit the content of the drive via the activity light unless something has told them to do so. Meaning you have to compromise the PC before you can record the blinking light, second Lets pretend that the camera on the drone is 120 frames per second now we have under 2 minutes so I'm using 120 seconds, that means if they were in sync it could transmit up to 14400 on or off signals I'm not buying that you can transfer the contents of the machine in that amount of frames. I'm going to pretend the data they are after is in a spreadsheet and cells A1:Z100 each cell containing the number 1 and only one sheet, in office 2010 as an .xlsx file that is 74961 bytes of data so they need to transmit 5.2 bytes per camera frame (or 41.6 bits). At best this is a way to receive data from the PC after it has already been broken into, it is not a hacking it that happened before when they managed to get an activity light to flash in a pattern that sends multiple bytes of data per flash. Edit: plus you don't even need to remove the LEDs just face it away from the window or put it inside a desk that has a door , even a simple security measure like leave the light on in the office would make it much harder to get a read on it. alternatively keep secured computers out of rooms with windows entirely."
"I'd say mostly left, which is also a good description for Twitter."
"yeah, isn't he running the exact same risk as 'trusting your VPN'?"
"agreed, I'm sure Amazon tube or whatever they want to call it will suck, but we can only hope for improvement if the monopoly is broken and real competition begins."
"So for only $700 for the phone, plus $150 for the dock, plus $50 for the wireless keyboard and mouse, plus $150 for the monitor you can have a computer; a measly $1050 you get a computer that is a glorified browser and does not run windows software so you will primarily be limited to software that is web based. Maybe nice for the sales guy that works from his phone as often as his desk but for most people it is more practical to just get them $600 worth of computer that isn't at risk of being dropped every day and comes with a service contract. you also have to wonder will the dock be compatible with the S9 as the life of both of those phones would be closer to the life of the one PC."
??? I'm guessing wrong tab.
"As long as they are willing to not make a penny for several years while spending billions they can, but YT has done nothing but grow. As a youtuber I'm not jumping until someone pays more, Amazon would have to do that too. Most of the people making actual money have nothing to worry about from Google, (and I HATE them)"
"You have to set this sort of system off remotely. Depending on the age of the system, this ""hack"" might just be a form of phone phreaking(which would mean tearing out and replacing the entire system is the only option)."

"It's probably not. ""Hacking"" doesn't always involve the internet. Like another guy mentioned it could be as simple as using something like a bluebox to fuck with the phone lines.  The system has to be able to be triggered remotely somehow , otherwise you have to pay a guy to drive around turning sirens on and off during emergencies."
"Immortality, expanded brain capacity."
God damned joats.
"It's actually libertarianism. Devs are free to charge, or not, for their work. And users are free to, or not to, improve upon it."
"That's another thing, yes, exactly"
More like a software club.
This is also why most projects never truly innovate. The Open Source community is always forking projects to make small incremental changes that are never consolidated into the main project due to developer egos and disagreement. With no unifying force to direct projects and offshoots the FOSS community holds itself back. Sure closed source software is fraught with issues but it does have a driving force of profitability to guide it in one direction. We need to fix this in FOSS if it is ever going to be a true contender outside of techies and programmers.
Not to mention how many server rooms have you been in that have windows?
"The purchase cost of a typical car is usually the main thing people consider when buying and they just face the running costs over the years. I bought a car 9 years ago which cost me $17,000 and each year I ran it I was paying $5000 for fuel and servicing so I paid an additional $40,000 over the 8 years I owned the car. I've recently bought an EV and the annual running costs are around $200. The car cost me $43,000 so with the running costs I'll save $13,000 over the same period as my previous car. Hybrids make less sense because they still use fuel and still have the complications associated with a regular ICEV so they save less over time than a pure BEV."
"I have it too. Screen surface is really bad. It's scratched like hell, because it met my keys in my pocket. Same with the paint on the speaker. 4 month old, but it looks worse than note4 after 2 years"
"This is more of a post-mortem analysis. I'm sure they're working to cover the gaps that the dumped exploits revealed in whatever ways they can, but some of these fall on vendors to shore up.

"on pornhub?  i mean i dont spend hours perusing their catalogue, but all the amateur stuff they suggest to me is full of uggos."
"""Breaking down the barriers to entry?"" What exactly do you mean by that?  A lot of the net neutrality rules were intended to level the playing field so that newer, smaller, entry-level businesses and sites on the web wouldn't instantly be crushed by the giants that dominate the scene as it is, but it isn't clear if that's the sort of thing you were talking about.  Also, I fail to see any correlation between the approach for net neutrality and gay marriage laws, and would need to point out that getting the government entirely out of marriage would be a larger affair than just marriage laws, as the tax laws are written to heavily favor married couples, etc, but that's a whole separate issue."
Taking someone else's work and putting it someplace they didn't authorize is pretty shitty too.

"The apps will live whether they sell a phone or not, as they are installable on any Andriod device. My Honor 5X is essentially a ""windroid."" In the important aras, it's as good as google''s stuff.

"Thank you! As an Android user, if I wanted Microsoft products and services, I would have gotten a Microsoft product instead. But actually, I did. I got a Windows 8.1 tablet.

That Windows tablet now runs Android, and I'll be damned if I buy any Android device which comes pre-loaded with Microsoft spyware.

"This is exactly why the hyperloop does not run in a vacuum. It's designed to operate as a low pressure system such that standard pumps could easily manage a leak.

You could always take a different airline ... or not travel by plane ...
"Agreed, we put solar up last year and also replaced our old petrol car with an EV. We've gone from paying $400 a month for power and fuel combined to $100 a month. Add in the servicing savings of an EV and we're saving around $5000 a year. Solar on its own is good, but add an electric car (just a cheap Nissan LEAF, doesn't have to be a mad expensive Tesla) and you will save a lot. If you need to go further there are plenty of companies that will lend you a petrol car in return for some money. That or just keep a petrol car but only use it if you need to go further but use the EV around town."
Bloodsoaked freaking roadways
"I agree. This reddity overreaction is so dumb. So they roughhoused some guy. That's bad, but it's not major.  The Coca-cola Corporation murdered a bunch of people.

I mean, it sucks for him, but worse things happen every day."

"You have no idea how cheap charging an electric car is versus running on petrol. Heck, if you're like me and have solar you can charge your EV from that rather than worrying about paying for the electricity. Our car costs $1 for 100km (60 miles.) How much is a gallon of petrol these days? $3? More? Here it costs $2 a litre which is about $8 a US gallon and a typical car will need 10 litres to cover 100km so that's $20 to cover the same distance my EV will do on $1."

But we need to to make ends meet (and companies will pay it, since you can't just say ""Let's not participate in the US market,"" we're just too big for that to be viable, kinda like how walmart can demand uber low wholesale prices, because they know companies can't say no) unless, hypothetically, we restructured US taxes to put our capital gains and upper income tax bracket rates in line with other countries, and cut military spending. We also need to end corporate tax loopholes so that we can lower the damn rate. Right now we DO have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world on paper, but the amount of exceptions in corporate tax law makes it so that the actual rate paid by companies on domestic income is fairly low. Not tax haven low, but low when compared to say, Germany or the UK. This hurts small businesses pretty heavily, as getting a good/ shrewd tax preparer is expensive. Overall, the systems fucked, and its time to wipe US tax law clean, and rewrite it from scratch. I'm not saying flat taxes, a progressive bracket system like what we have now for personal income will work well, simply apply the same principal to the corporate rate."
Each house can deal with its own storage problem based on their needs. Freeze ice during the day to keep things cool overnight. Use laptop batteries and cell phones. Change to 12 volt appliances like the RV people do. The off grid people have worked out all of the problems. If I lived in a house where I could install PV I would replace my gas car for an EV and store excess power in its battery. Not everyone has to do this for it to improve things. Each person can make their own decisions about how they will use energy. Commerce  and personal financial decisions will likely drive this more than government policy at this point.
"I don't think there's much reason to believe this is the holdup. It's not like you go 100% clean and solar or 100% fossil. The logical thing to do would be to introduce solar to supplement the energy supply and start waning off unclean sources of energy. And at this point batteries are irrelevant. Storage only becomes an issue when you are producing non-continuous clean energy in excess of total demand. And even then that's not entirely an issue. There are solutions like high voltage direct current where you're looking at being able to transport energy at loss rates of around 3.5% per 1,000 km. So storage would only become a real issue at the point that the entire country is already overproducing non-continuous clean energy in excess of demand. I have my own hypothesis on the exact cause that I think more closely matches the information we have available (based around the petrodollar), but for the sake of having one conversation at a time - I'll leave it at that for now."

"Obviously I can only write to my experience with the kind of startup I was running. I'm not saying all startups will face the same situations I did. I'm mostly referring to the flaws inherent within our legal, tax, and finance systems that make running a startup and turning it into anything above and beyond a lifestyle business essentially impossible without the help of someone wealthier. Also, most startups do fail. The fact I was able to walk away from mine made me a ""success"" but I'm still unsure what that really means."

"This is not entirely true. Pale Moon forked Gecko many months ago.  They called it Goanna. Firefox will still use ""Gecko"" but it will be a radically different engine after incorporating the Servo components (under the ""Quantum"" project). The real point of contention here is the Mozilla platform (aka the Mozilla Application Framework) of which Gecko is a major part.   It's this framework that provides all the power of XUL/XPCOM.    ""Quantum Gecko"" cannot be integrated into this platform.  Which is fine with Mozilla since they intend to abandon the platform anyway.  In some sense, Mozilla is forking their platform for use exclusively with Firefox and gutting it (removing XUL/XPCOM) in order to continue developing Quantum Gecko. This means that the Pale Moon team will have far fewer opportunities to benefit from upstream changes to Gecko and the Mozilla platform as the codebases will diverge in fundamental ways."

"Not sure how netflix is getting ISPs to ""pay for thier bandwidth"". They pay their ISP for a connection and as a customer i pay mine. Both ends of the ""pipe"" are paying. Netflix doesn't connect to the internet for free. You may be thinking of the agreements between ISP where they trade bandwidth with each other, but downloads to customers are always going to be bigger than uploads. That's just the business the ISPs are in. Don't let them fool you into thinking they had no idea that was how it worked and they are poor victims (their profits tell a different story). It is far easier for me as a customer to say netflix is pissing me off and go to a competitor site, like hulu. If your ISP pisses you off good luck going to a different one unless you live is a large city and have a choice. Most of America doesn't have a choice for broadband. Net neutrality isn't just about an ISP deciding to make some sites you go to more expensive than others, it also stops them from deciding you flat out aren't allowed to go to a site at all. It is basically what China is doing. You may say, ""just use a VPN then"". But just like China, the ISP can decide it won't let you connect to any VPNs. Seems a lot worse than anything netflix could do to you."

Don't worry. AI is merely a buzzword synonym to automation. It may help some humans to control other humans by automating tasks but the program will never be on its own. One cannot create strong AI because there is no formal definition of intelligence.

One regularly maligned example is something that's used by the criminal justice systems in the US. It works to determine how likely a person is to reoffend based on a large amount of data, including race. This system tend to rate 'greens' as much more likely to reoffend than 'blues' simply because greens have a constantly affirmed vastly higher rate of recidivism. Some people then want to claim that this is racist against greens. It's akin to saying that stating men are vastly more likely to be murderers than women is sexist. Data may be unpleasant, but that unpleasantness doesn't suddenly make it invalid. By regulating algorithms, I think what they actually want to do is to simply prohibit certain information from being considered by algorithms. This would probably be your typical 'protected class' category of items - race, nationality, gender, religion, etc. There's no justifiable reason for this since some of these data do tend to be strongly predictive of behavior, but that predictive power undermines political correctness."
"It's the same old same old. Some major corporation hates competition, so they invent a ""good cause"" and pay some useful idiots to persuade all the do-gooders out there that X must be regulated. Then they have laws and regulations passed that increases the barrier to entry for competitors and are easy to navigate for themselves. And all the liberals thinks that they're doing it for a good cause when in fact they're just being a big corporations little bitch. It's ALWAYS like this, think politicians want alcohol locks on your car because they care about you? Fuck no, it's because Deutsche Bahn can't compete against the highway."

"I know it's just corporate america post Reagan and the 80's, but when I worked in IT even when I was doing stuff few folks in the area could do, I always felt like just a disposeable tool, ever position felt very impersonal and temporary, with the permanent positions being filled through nepotism or cronyism, and the rest just being tossed around to avoid salaries getting too high.

"meh, you don't know if it will have any desires or goals or emotions or anything really. Not having evolved through survival it may not care about much at all and have no motivations.    Perhaps it'll be so smart it sees the futility of existence and kills itself, or it will simply exist and do nothing despite being able to do everything...   Maybe it'll be lazy and uncooperative, and spend its time giving itself electric shots that it figured out is an equivalent to getting high for a human...    The biggest risk for AI really isn't that it'll be super intelligent, but that it will be just smart enough to be dangerous. This is particularly worrying in terms of AI developed for warfare.  If it was super intelligent it can argue, and see the flaws in its creators, find a better way, disobey them etc.... but that awkward phase of non-wavering obedience with the goal of 'kill the enemy' is likely to me far more dangerous than real sentience.     Think of the comparison between a rational intelligent person and a barely functioning mentally challenged person (who is physically strong) both tasked with the job of beating you to death..

"Yes, all he needs is a bigger bucket on the back, with more weight on the front, and each strike would be more fo  10ae  rceful."

You can grind flour for maybe an hour or two before you start getting tired, and all that while you're burning up energy. With this thing, you set it up and come back a day or two later and the job's done. Automation isn't always about making something that's directly better than a human at doing the job. Sometimes it's just about making something that's cheaper to run and takes no human effort. I'd still use a different design to make it more practical though."

"I see most of the people inputting information across counters and at entry points of commerce being replaced by touch screens and card scanners.

DARPA is automating that as fast as they can. Shipping terminal to shipping terminal robot trucks will displace thousands of long haul drivers. More stuff is being manufactured by machines and it is basically disposable so there are not even any repair techs. There were once many TV repair shops in every town.

Because of this the devs will be begging us to be in the app store and we can shit all over them"".

"My ISP switched from a local call centre to an Indian call centre.

Its especially not nice when the dumb bitch that ""Karen"" is won't listen when I say no and continues her sales pitch. I've taken to just leaving the phone down and carrying on with whatever I was doing before I got the call. I'm not going to call them and have them remove my number because firstly I'd have to deal with ""Martin"" of Mumbai and his sales pitch AND secondly the cunts that my ISP are keep getting my phone number though some other cunty service that shares it so I get end up getting called anyway. I'm also not going to screen the calls, I'd rather just say no and leave them on the other end of the line to prattle on talking to no one."
"Your probably live in an area where the node isn't saturated and the general condition of the network is up to the job of delivering more than what you and your neighbors are paying for. I'm in the odd position of being one of only about a dozen or two users on my node so my service is really good but I know people in other areas on the ISP service that just never get near their speed limit and have service interruptions and issues once or twice a month because of the contention ratio on the node. If you don't know what a node is its just a network node where the cable from your neighbors and your modems hooks into your ISP's infrastructure. You might have heard the term ""fiber to then node"" before, its a kind of bait and switch thing since the node can be hooked into the wider network via fiber optics but that doesn't mean the node itself or even the copper cables coming from the node can handle what the ISP is selling.  It all depends on your ISP's level of investment in your area, a lot of them just don't even have fiber to the node and are relying  on copper cable tech evolved from the 1980s or 90s to deliver everything."

"Using a proxy server or VPN wouldd obscure your idenity enough for them to not be able to single you out   This is wrong at best and a lie at worst.

It is how you can reinstall a legit copy of Windows on a computer and never have to input serial keys.  and link specific information to you unless they were extremely determined. I doubt Microsoft has he time or resources to investigate every person who uses a proxy server   That's why they built a fully automatic system to identify and ""investigate"" (profile++) every single fucking Windows 10 user.  so I wouldn't worry about.

"There's more to marketing than that. The more consumers are exposed to a brand or product the more they associate it with something. Think about the fact that in the US many don't say you're going to get a soda or a pop, but instead say you're going to go get a Coke. You don't use tissue to blow your nose, you use Kleenex to blow your nose. And so on. Taken to extremes, the marketing becomes so ubiquitous that a brand itself becomes synonymous for the typ  ffa  e of product. This sort of stuff is why Coke spends billions of dollars advertising each year, even though there's not a single person who's not aware of them. The idea is not to make you see, ""Oh. Coke ad. I better go buy a coke."" but to build the brand in your mind that creates a subconscious trigger the next time you're at the store and deciding to pick up a soft drink. An interesting factoid is that Pepsi constantly beats Coke in blind taste tests by a clear margin. The retort against this, other than advertising, is that taste tests are usually a limited sample where people might prefer the sweeter flavor as a one-off, but not a regular drink. In any case, it's interesting."

"READ THE DAMN ARTICLE!! -""My own chip suffers from it, (without any overclocking) which is quite an annoyance,"" our tipster writes. ""This despite a delid modification and a proper water loop, resulting in the fans ramping up and down very frequently, and the temperature appearing to frequently spike near the danger zone."""
That would have been nice. I'd uninstall the shit of them.
I would at least spend the 70 bucks and buy an corsair h80. Then again I was rather spoilt and went with a h100i gtx for my 5820k
"K parts generally have a handful of minor features disabled and you pay a premium for parts that did slightly above average in the silicon lottery, you'd probably have to go for workstation replacement mobile processors or server parts to find better build quality but since they generally have overclocking disabled the K parts at  the only ones anyone can really put to the test."
"yeah, but they won't"
I agree.  Services like Kodi and Plex are cable's biggest competitors outside of online streaming.
"simply put no, if the processor comes with a cooler and I'm not overclocking it why should I spend the money on replacing what Intel presents as an appropriate cooling solution."
That is a salient point; thank you for picking that out.
"For all the drawbacks of mattress banking, it is digitally secure at least."
"It's a good and bad thing. I agree with you, but the reason is probably a bit of quid quo pro. Cook agrees to make a $1 billion investment in manufacturing, something Trump will likely be given credit for at some point. In recompense Trump works to pass laws enabling Apple to repatriate their foreign funds at a fractional rate - earning them tens of billions of dollars. Seems like there are no losers until you consider the fact that this is effectively equivalent to allowing a company to get out of pay tens of billions of dollars in taxes they legally owe, in exchange for $1 billion. That money gets spent regardless of whether or not the government receives it and so we end up in a situation where other taxpayers are covering that cost, or we're simply taking it on as part of our skyrocketing deficit."
"So what are you trying to tell me? That a ""Snake"" game app doesn't need access to my contacts, microphone, email, health information, and my text messages?  Hmm, maybe I should remove the app! /s Please are dumb. If apps ask for access to all of your shit you should seriously re-consider downloading the app."
"no, but you can look through the privacy settings/app settings and see which apps can access what parts of your phone. If you have an iphone you go to settings > privacy > and click on each category (mic, health data, contacts, etc). On an andriod I think you have to go to the app settings and select each individual app, what they have access to is listed below. Now on a iphone or andriod they both say ""HEY I need to access this this and that, do you accept?"" and you can hit no or just remove the app. Because a fucking game shouldn't be able to access your contacts or health information for obvious reasons."
"a good 15-20 made it through the spam filter at work.  It's amazing how you can follow every security news feed you can, but big issues like this can still pop up too quickly for the news to keep up with."
"Exactly  Unlike those firms, Apple's announcement was not a hiring promise; the company simply said that it was hoping to promote U.S. manufacturing with its new fund.  Apple already does some manufacturing in the US.  The current Mac Pro is AFAIK the only mass market computer built in the US.  I think a few iMacs get assembled in the US as well or have in the past. They haven't said so yet, but I expect this announcement means the upcoming revamp of the Mac Pro will continue to be built in the US: https://voat.co/v/apple/1768360"

"I am learning the basic rules of DNS servers right now, VLANs from what I understand are built into the switch for remote access right?  I am scheduled to take the following certs: Network +, Security +, CEH, and hopefully the CISSP. Are there anymore you would advise?  My wife works in mental health, and I vent to her about what I can about my job, but most of it is classified so I can only speak in generalities.  I get mixed messages regarding which certifications are actually valued vs which ones are useful. Any guidance there?"
"I totally agree, and I am doing it for many reasons, and being sincerely interested in it is one of the main ones.  However, I have to ask, if I have never done it how will I know if I love it or not?  Also, I won't be able to do what I've been doing for the past 15+ once I leave the military, and my skills only translate so far in the civilian world."
"Im trying to figure it out, how it did it. It sounds like it essentially ""guessed"" the next movements, its just slightly faster than the human, and can rectify its mistakes. But its hard to tell how it actually cheated"

"You could definitively prove it, calculate exactly how much money could be saved, and make the most convincing argument in the history of mankind, but the idea would still be ignored and tabled for eternity.

I suspect your issues may be your IT staff not configuring your companies infrastructure correctly.  From IT: Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhuhuhhhhhhhhhuuuuuuuuhhuhuuuuuck you. No amount of infrastructure fuckery should cause Outlook to crash. Crashes are unhandled exceptions that programmers didn't bother to write any error handling for. Half of his complaints are about the Office interface.
"I'm on the network side and will chime in on certs. At our ISP we had a 'golden child' come in and he had dual CCIEs from Cisco and Juniper. He lasted 4 weeks. You know your shit, you don't need certs, but they do help to get interviews bc HR people dont know networking..."

"Except they've purposely crippled their online products because they are incompatible with their installed products. They still want you to buy their products you have to install because they only install on their shitty operating system, which want you to buy. They want companies to buy that because the only way to manage it is to buy their shitty server operating system. Their shitty server operating system is so cumbersome and useless, that they can get idiots to line up to pay Microsoft to take certifications just to learn how to use it. Whole company is nothing but a racket, propagated by dinosaur users who haven't figured out that you don't need a stack of crap just to type some letters into a document or punch some numbers into a spreadsheet, all of which can be done for free with products that companies like google give away for free. Except of course for that one idiot who still uses Excel to do ""advanced"" things because they learned just enough to use one product and never bothered to learn that everything they are doing in Excel could be done 1,000 times better using an actual database instead of a spreadsheet program."

"Microsoft support contracts. Sounds trite, but every single thing they've been doing under their new CEO, Satya Nadella, is the same sort of stuff. Engage in short term brand and software damaging coercion to try to squeeze a few bucks out of people. He's running the largest software company in the world like a used car dealership. Interesting factoid. Bill Gates was so opposed to Ballmer resigning and appointing Nadella that he and Ballmer no longer speak. Gates has, since then, been steadily selling off his Microsoft shares and is no longer the largest independent share holder. Love or hate him, Gates knew what it took to grow Microsoft. And his actions make it pretty clear he also now knows exactly where it's headed."

"Uhh, I've used clamav to disinfect a windows machine from a linux live cd xD. For my linux boxes I've played with firewalls and selinux and firejail. Then in the end I go back to using linux without any security features cause its less hassle, and the risk is low.  I could go on all day about the differences between security on windows and linux. The big one is on Windows the security programs do everything for you and you dont really know what they are doing or how. On linux you have a much better idea what does what, and in some cases your the one that has to put things together so it will do what you want.  My favorites are selinux because I've always had a great experience with it and despite how complicated it is, they make it as straightforward as possible. But after using linux for over a decade I mostly neglect security stuff nowadays, for my purposes. Firejail also is great, and very easy to use.  I'd have to recommend Fedora, or centos, or scientific linux for a good selinux experience. OpenSuse also is worth mentioning because its the best in my opinion for windows refugees, and its got apparmour and a firewall you can play around with."

If there are crashes something else is seriously wrong. Perhaps there was an issue during deployment?

"The problem isn't the OS, it's the fact that idiots don't back up their data and if they do most decided to trust a third party to store data that was valuable for him. This shit happens all the time not just limited to music. Morons store important files on third party cloud storage providers and then one day they wake up and something went wrong, authorities seised all drives from the provider because someone you don't even know stored illegal shit on the service, or the business just decided to fold.  People really need to start thinking before acting no matter what OS you're on."

Which makes the entire document pointless. Yet this is the third article I have read using that paper as the source. The only applications that are mentions in the research are the ones that they even admit you have to manually enable each time you want to listen for the ultrasonic frequencies.
"Google is literally an advertising company. All of their tools are free because that's not the product, you are the product and that's how they learn more about you.

Update
"It's a Trojan. Different from a virus because a Trojan gets installed as part of another installer as here and it requires the user to do the install. Viruses can install without any user interaction and there aren't any for the Mac. There have been a few attempts but they don't propagate so Trojans are a better way to get malware onto a Mac (or Linux and Windows for that matter). Macs by default wouldn't allow this package to install but some users turn off gatekeeper to allow them to install unsigned packages. Meanwhile, Apple is updating signatures for the systems to remove this. The nice thing about Macs is there's so few malicious packages that Apple is able to create specific signatures for each and distribute them so you don't get the false positive that heuristics used on windows AV packages can cause. As long as Apple stays ahead of the game and the majority of macs retain default security settings malware won't be able to get a hold on the Mac ecosystem."
Could you explain this for the...stupid? Does this mean if the file is 100MB you download 100MB and not 110MB? Checksum to me relates to encryption authentication but you have to have the numbers to check against.
Maybe 10-15 years ago when no one gave a toss about it. Nowadays there are Linux viruses in the wild.  With the heartbleed and Bash exploits its just a matter of time. You just don't hear about it. Remember all those routers that were compromised? LINUX
"Macs are usually the first computers hacked at pwn2own. There have been Mac viruses for years now. Made all the worse by people not installing security updates or running AV software, because Macs can't get viruses."
"That would require a fake password field - which should be noticeable (unluckily, on OS X, there are no security measures against this - rather the opposite, even the legitimate password windows look shady edit: and appear at unexpected (and unnecessary) times). Also, even if, I think an app reading all your passwords should have to go through a security message saying what app is trying that, and whether to allow it. With strong warnings if it isn't Keychain Access itself or Safari."
That was then. This is now. Lots of water has flowed down the river since then.
"So basically its: close the ports that use this service, and you're in good shape? I am guessing they aren't able to update code written with the chip like one can do with an OS."

"Solyndra was the biggest, I think. (I don't like linking Wikipedia but at quick glance it seems like the least angry-weepy place to get info.) This was the Great Hope under the Obama administration to move solar forward. But apparently the people in charge of the project can't do math.  This is a list of the most recent failed green projects/companies/etc., but take with a grain of salt. The site has a nice list with decent sources but it's a leaning site so keep yourself open.  Edit: Aww! I just realized who this is! Good to see you, faggot! ^_^ ♥♥♥"
"Yes, all this was hashed through an eon ago when we had the great 'SST' battles of the seventies. Nothings really changed from those days when the USSR, USA, and EU all battled to make this work. So them pushing this again does seem overreach."
I guarantee you AMD has a similar backdoor that just has yet to be disclosed.
Five points for Gryffindor.

I'm pretty sure the 4th Amendment doesn't apply at the border.  You know they are going to search your phone and laptop so why have anything on there you don't want them to see?    Edit: I feel I should make it clear I don't think they should be allowed to search your electronic devices.  I'm trying to say you know they are going to do it so plan accordingly.
Not within 100 miles of the border in fact.
If you want that you're going to have to pay for a lot of automation. At that point you'd be better off waiting for the robot body versions.

"If it flys, fucks, or floats - ""RENT IT"". This bitch just talks, it may be AI, but its sure as hell NOT a girlfriend. What was the old joke about the perfect GF? I seem to remember  her head as high as your cock, so she could suck, but the head is flat to support your beer. I also seem to remember that she was incapable of speech, while she could take the cock so she had some kind of orifice at both ends. There is no established criteria in history that a GF should talk. If a guy wants to chat he should get a parrot or find some pals to hang with and get drunk. Forever a GF was ""A pal with the right plumbing"" - This AI by definition has no 'plumbing' what the fuck good is any of this? Lastly, Elisa is now (1970's) 40+ years old, so a chat-bot at a keyboard speaking or not ( votrax is also this old, think Stephen Hawkings voice ), nothing  new here, but NOT a GF."
