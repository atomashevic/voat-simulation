"Right on, and certainly not from me, I see an advert on MSM, I will make it a point not to buy that specific product or frequent that specific store."

5 minute ads should be a crime.
Well
"You have to be a computer-retard  Most people are.... that's why they use their mobile phones, but can't block ads because youtube is a walled-garden app. I can't wait until people start seeing mobile using with the same contempt as me â€” they're the most vulnerable to propaganda, but they're too busy being instantly gratified to understand why."
"I am a terrible person, but also watch a ton of youtube alt channels and cant stand commercials, so I started the yt red bit. Turns out, according to some of the ones I watch, they are making mor emoney from me now they are getting blocked than grom the advertisers. Yes, I hate google as much as everyone else. I fail in being lazy though, started the shit over a year ago, and am too lazy to discontinue..."
How the fuck do I use it? I remember installing it and having no clue what to do next. Hint: if your WWW replacement needs a tutorial then it's shit and not worth considering. There's TOR if I absolutely need anonymity.
"Most of these personalities are critical of the shit MSM pushes, and some have more (journalistic) integrity than those assholes whose livelihood depends on staying on the narrative. Plus they convey those ideas faster and in more bite-size entertaining ways."
How low would minimum wage need to be for the humans to be competitive with these robots?
I'd rather have a horse.
"Yeah it most likely will be spectacular, similar to when a plane crashes hard and 200+ people die. What ultimately matters is cold hard data about whether it's safer than alternate forms of transportation. The situation is similar with planes, when they crash it's always a big deal but statistically driving a car is more likely to lead to your death or injury. Only time will tell, but since the hyperloop doesn't have to share it's route at all or even partially like trains do, most likely it will be very very safe."
Walled garden + high level of understanding needed to use high-tech stuff = profit?
"I disagree withe flying cards and space corridors.  Even if it is realized by 2050, it wont be common or wide spread.    A new race of bioengineering people.... same deal, it might have started, but not in any significant numbers           traditional family and religions replaced by the new age ? not sure what you mean there...... religion is not easily displaced.     I don't think home robots will be all that common (but will have taken over most of industry and a sizable chunk of commercial work), but poorly designed and vulnerable integrated IoT will be absolutely everywhere."
"lol, thats awesome"
"Silent, but deadly!"
sigh
"The problem within the open source community is just that. Every time something fucks up, the project gets forked and thats it. But it never addresses the issue of confrontation. The SJW keep the main project ""alive"", the fork gets more commits against it and voila. But the SJW thinks they won, and the project fork becomes the new ""master"". The same strategy is used in very big corps too, the department is rebranded, but the issue is never ever resolved because no one bothered to talk to the retards and tell them to STFU. It really doesnt help that the SJW ""logic"" is based off ideas that are not tangible or in any way measurable(Probably intentional)"
Chill out dude. Your just jealous your not a student.
"If that was from mythbusters, the rail car that imploded had to take a significant hit to DENT the steel before the vacuum implosion thing worked. Before that it did not matter that the rail car was set for decommissioning and very covered in rust and the safety features were removed. Seriously, an inch or two of steel is enough to keep a vacuum from collapsing the shell. This is the principle for our space vehicles and submarines."
"I have no issue with seeing ads when I deal with free content, the problem is when the ads exceed the content. Many sites have more ad space then text in articles, and yes I count the ads for their own stuff as ads. for me My limit is about 1/10th ad, for a 30 minute video that means you get one 3 minute chunk of ad time, or for many of you ~8 minutes videos all over youtube you get 45 seconds, watching a 3 minute music video you get 18 seconds. any more then that and I'm skipping out on the whole thing, I will not sit through 15-20 minutes of ads mixed into 45 minutes of content like on TV, at that point I would rather pay for the service then waste my time watching the ads. Basically my issue isn't that I refuse to see ads but that I refuse to give up 1/4 of my time, or 2/3 of my reading space to them my tolerance for ads has dropped. Especially in any media that I have to pay for as well, so cable or satellite that charges X amount and then wants 1/4 of my time for ads is completely unacceptable to me."
"hope Brave crushes Firefox.  I thought the same thing like a year ago... truth is, it's just not that great."
"I would be cautiously pesimistic about this, if not outright laughing.  Check out Thunderf00t and hyperloop.  Stupid idea."
"Yeah this smacks of bullshit, computers do not transmit the content of the drive via the activity light unless something has told them to do so. Meaning you have to compromise the PC before you can record the blinking light, second Lets pretend that the camera on the drone is 120 frames per second now we have under 2 minutes so I'm using 120 seconds, that means if they were in sync it could transmit up to 14400 on or off signals I'm not buying that you can transfer the contents of the machine in that amount of frames. I'm going to pretend the data they are after is in a spreadsheet and cells A1:Z100 each cell containing the number 1 and only one sheet, in office 2010 as an .xlsx file that is 74961 bytes of data so they need to transmit 5.2 bytes per camera frame (or 41.6 bits). At best this is a way to receive data from the PC after it has already been broken into, it is not a hacking it that happened before when they managed to get an activity light to flash in a pattern that sends multiple bytes of data per flash. Edit: plus you don't even need to remove the LEDs just face it away from the window or put it inside a desk that has a door , even a simple security measure like leave the light on in the office would make it much harder to get a read on it. alternatively keep secured computers out of rooms with windows entirely."
"I'd say mostly left, which is also a good description for Twitter."
"yeah, isn't he running the exact same risk as 'trusting your VPN'?"
"agreed, I'm sure Amazon tube or whatever they want to call it will suck, but we can only hope for improvement if the monopoly is broken and real competition begins."
"So for only $700 for the phone, plus $150 for the dock, plus $50 for the wireless keyboard and mouse, plus $150 for the monitor you can have a computer; a measly $1050 you get a computer that is a glorified browser and does not run windows software so you will primarily be limited to software that is web based. Maybe nice for the sales guy that works from his phone as often as his desk but for most people it is more practical to just get them $600 worth of computer that isn't at risk of being dropped every day and comes with a service contract. you also have to wonder will the dock be compatible with the S9 as the life of both of those phones would be closer to the life of the one PC."
??? I'm guessing wrong tab.
"As long as they are willing to not make a penny for several years while spending billions they can, but YT has done nothing but grow. As a youtuber I'm not jumping until someone pays more, Amazon would have to do that too. Most of the people making actual money have nothing to worry about from Google, (and I HATE them)"
"You have to set this sort of system off remotely. Depending on the age of the system, this ""hack"" might just be a form of phone phreaking(which would mean tearing out and replacing the entire system is the only option)."
i'm sure they know that... but... i'd rather not be on the first gen aircraft

"It's probably not. ""Hacking"" doesn't always involve the internet. Like another guy mentioned it could be as simple as using something like a bluebox to fuck with the phone lines.  The system has to be able to be triggered remotely somehow , otherwise you have to pay a guy to drive around turning sirens on and off during emergencies."
"Immortality, expanded brain capacity."
God damned joats.
"It's actually libertarianism. Devs are free to charge, or not, for their work. And users are free to, or not to, improve upon it."
"That's another thing, yes, exactly"
More like a software club.
This is also why most projects never truly innovate. The Open Source community is always forking projects to make small incremental changes that are never consolidated into the main project due to developer egos and disagreement. With no unifying force to direct projects and offshoots the FOSS community holds itself back. Sure closed source software is fraught with issues but it does have a driving force of profitability to guide it in one direction. We need to fix this in FOSS if it is ever going to be a true contender outside of techies and programmers.
Not to mention how many server rooms have you been in that have windows?
"The purchase cost of a typical car is usually the main thing people consider when buying and they just face the running costs over the years. I bought a car 9 years ago which cost me $17,000 and each year I ran it I was paying $5000 for fuel and servicing so I paid an additional $40,000 over the 8 years I owned the car. I've recently bought an EV and the annual running costs are around $200. The car cost me $43,000 so with the running costs I'll save $13,000 over the same period as my previous car. Hybrids make less sense because they still use fuel and still have the complications associated with a regular ICEV so they save less over time than a pure BEV."
"I have it too. Screen surface is really bad. It's scratched like hell, because it met my keys in my pocket. Same with the paint on the speaker. 4 month old, but it looks worse than note4 after 2 years"
"This is more of a post-mortem analysis. I'm sure they're working to cover the gaps that the dumped exploits revealed in whatever ways they can, but some of these fall on vendors to shore up. Most of these are based on zero-days which the intelligence community (quite unethically) hoarded for their use."

"I've been loving my 1800x, though if I had any kind of budget this would have been the chip I waited for and if these are anything like the r7s series I'd probably get the 1500 and just overclock that."
"do you currently live there?    Or is it just where you hail from? I'd like to hear a first-hand account of daily life in portugal from a voater, but i havent seen any around."

"on pornhub?  i mean i dont spend hours perusing their catalogue, but all the amateur stuff they suggest to me is full of uggos."
"""Breaking down the barriers to entry?"" What exactly do you mean by that?  A lot of the net neutrality rules were intended to level the playing field so that newer, smaller, entry-level businesses and sites on the web wouldn't instantly be crushed by the giants that dominate the scene as it is, but it isn't clear if that's the sort of thing you were talking about.  Also, I fail to see any correlation between the approach for net neutrality and gay marriage laws, and would need to point out that getting the government entirely out of marriage would be a larger affair than just marriage laws, as the tax laws are written to heavily favor married couples, etc, but that's a whole separate issue."
Taking someone else's work and putting it someplace they didn't authorize is pretty shitty too.
They have to make rules because our business ethics dissolved. I'd say this could be a move in the right direction

"AMD CPUs have their own implementation called PSP any big x86 CPU made after 2013 all have hardware ""rootkits"" built in."
And what is better?
Most of the rules and regulations in the states have anything to do with consumer choice. They have to do with restricting access to competitors and what they want to sell is limited access to the programs they choose. A Free for all internet means that  627   information which is something alot of these companies peddle on the television is no longer under there control They need control they desire it its something they are going to fight to get again.
I apologize for the mistake. It'll be removed now.

"The apps will live whether they sell a phone or not, as they are installable on any Andriod device. My Honor 5X is essentially a ""windroid."" In the important aras, it's as good as google''s stuff. I sold a business on 22 similar handsets. They bought S7's (dumbasses) but I loaded them all with MS software. They don't need to release a phone with a mobile OS, they can just maintain the apps as they are now. They're releasing full windows on a phone later this year."

"Yup, any modern train is so much more cost efficient."
"Thank you! As an Android user, if I wanted Microsoft products and services, I would have gotten a Microsoft product instead. But actually, I did. I got a Windows 8.1 tablet. The assistive features for the blind were a complete fucking joke, especially the screen magnifier. No improvements were made to this whatsoever in Windows 10. That Windows tablet now runs Android, and I'll be damned if I buy any Android device which comes pre-loaded with Microsoft spyware. Say what you want about Google, but at least Google knows how to design a decent user interface while providing an OS that doesn't take up 10 gigabytes."
"This is exactly why the hyperloop does not run in a vacuum. It's designed to operate as a low pressure system such that standard pumps could easily manage a leak. The whitepaper goes into some detail on pump speed vs pressure range and all other sorts of stuff. It's oddly enough also very readable, though perhaps not as exciting as a mybusters clip."

You could always take a different airline ... or not travel by plane ...
"Agreed, we put solar up last year and also replaced our old petrol car with an EV. We've gone from paying $400 a month for power and fuel combined to $100 a month. Add in the servicing savings of an EV and we're saving around $5000 a year. Solar on its own is good, but add an electric car (just a cheap Nissan LEAF, doesn't have to be a mad expensive Tesla) and you will save a lot. If you need to go further there are plenty of companies that will lend you a petrol car in return for some money. That or just keep a petrol car but only use it if you need to go further but use the EV around town."
Bloodsoaked freaking roadways
"I agree. This reddity overreaction is so dumb. So they roughhoused some guy. That's bad, but it's not major.  The Coca-cola Corporation murdered a bunch of people. Microsoft, Google, and Facebook violated the constitutional rights of billions. I honestly don't care that much that one stranger got roughhoused. I mean, it sucks for him, but worse things happen every day."
"Because they wanted to build a robot called Tarzan and that's how they justified the grant. Sloths have efficient locomotion for legged creatures. Where a suitable surface is available, wheels are flat-out better. That's why Boston Dynamics went from building cybermen to building freakish segway centaur things."
Southwest doesn't do enough maintenance on their planes and almost killed me once. It's like something is dragging the whole airline system down.

"Heh yeah, I thought they ran out of unallocated IPV4 a while back. Of course, given the bewildering N-layer NAT monstrosity that the web has become, it's far less of an issue than we thought it'd be."

"This sort of tech is also not anywhere near reliable as breathalyzers, even assuming they're actually detecting THC levels on the breath.  With THC, the body develops a tolerance, so someone at a certain blood percentage may or may not be impaired based on their tolerance.  This is not true with alcohol, so it's easy to set a baseline blood percentage and call it impaired for alcohol, but is not anywhere near as reliable with THC.  The fact that this article didn't mention that is not indicative of good, unbiased science."

Here it costs $2 a litre which is about $8 a US gallon and a typical car will need 10 litres to cover 100km so that's $20 to cover the same distance my EV will do on $1."
Every little bit helps.

"Really we shouldn't be taxing the foreign earnings of our corporations as very few other nations do this. It puts us at a competitive disadvantage.  agreed, as it encourages them to take money out of the US. But we need to to make ends meet (and companies will pay it, since you can't just say ""Let's not participate in the US market,"" we're just too big for that to be viable, kinda like how walmart can demand uber low wholesale prices, because they know companies can't say no) unless, hypothetically, we restructured US taxes to put our capital gains and upper income tax bracket rates in line with other countries, and cut military spending. We also need to end corporate tax loopholes so that we can lower the damn rate. Right now we DO have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world on paper, but the amount of exceptions in corporate tax law makes it so that the actual rate paid by companies on domestic income is fairly low. Not tax haven low, but low when compared to say, Germany or the UK. This hurts small businesses pretty heavily, as getting a good/ shrewd tax preparer is expensive. Overall, the systems fucked, and its time to wipe US tax law clean, and rewrite it from scratch. I'm not saying flat taxes, a progressive bracket system like what we have now for personal income will work well, simply apply the same principal to the corporate rate."
Each house can deal with its own storage problem based on their needs. Freeze ice during the day to keep things cool overnight. Use laptop batteries and cell phones. Change to 12 volt appliances like the RV people do. The off grid people have worked out all of the problems. If I lived in a house where I could install PV I would replace my gas car for an EV and store excess power in its battery. Not everyone has to do this for it to improve things. Each person can make their own decisions about how they will use energy. Commerce  and personal financial decisions will likely drive this more than government policy at this point.
"I don't think there's much reason to believe this is the holdup. It's not like you go 100% clean and solar or 100% fossil. The logical thing to do would be to introduce solar to supplement the energy supply and start waning off unclean sources of energy. And at this point batteries are irrelevant. Storage only becomes an issue when you are producing non-continuous clean energy in excess of total demand. And even then that's not entirely an issue. There are solutions like high voltage direct current where you're looking at being able to transport energy at loss rates of around 3.5% per 1,000 km. So storage would only become a real issue at the point that the entire country is already overproducing non-continuous clean energy in excess of demand. I have my own hypothesis on the exact cause that I think more closely matches the information we have available (based around the petrodollar), but for the sake of having one conversation at a time - I'll leave it at that for now."

"This is not entirely true. Pale Moon forked Gecko many months ago.  They called it Goanna. Firefox will still use ""Gecko"" but it will be a radically different engine after incorporating the Servo components (under the ""Quantum"" project). The real point of contention here is the Mozilla platform (aka the Mozilla Application Framework) of which Gecko is a major part.   It's this framework that provides all the power of XUL/XPCOM.    ""Quantum Gecko"" cannot be integrated into this platform.  Which is fine with Mozilla since they intend to abandon the platform anyway.  In some sense, Mozilla is forking their platform for use exclusively with Firefox and gutting it (removing XUL/XPCOM) in order to continue developing Quantum Gecko. This means that the Pale Moon team will have far fewer opportunities to benefit from upstream changes to Gecko and the Mozilla platform as the codebases will diverge in fundamental ways."

"Not sure how netflix is getting ISPs to ""pay for thier bandwidth"". They pay their ISP for a connection and as a customer i pay mine. Both ends of the ""pipe"" are paying. Netflix doesn't connect to the internet for free. You may be thinking of the agreements between ISP where they trade bandwidth with each other, but downloads to customers are always going to be bigger than uploads. That's just the business the ISPs are in. Don't let them fool you into thinking they had no idea that was how it worked and they are poor victims (their profits tell a different story). It is far easier for me as a customer to say netflix is pissing me off and go to a competitor site, like hulu. If your ISP pisses you off good luck going to a different one unless you live is a large city and have a choice. Most of America doesn't have a choice for broadband. Net neutrality isn't just about an ISP deciding to make some sites you go to more expensive than others, it also stops them from deciding you flat out aren't allowed to go to a site at all. It is basically what China is doing. You may say, ""just use a VPN then"". But just like China, the ISP can decide it won't let you connect to any VPNs. Seems a lot worse than anything netflix could do to you."

That's the problem. I've bought laptop from $200 to $900 and they all come with realktek? It's been like 5-6 laptops. It might be a cheap card but for such a common card it should be supported 100%.

"Trump is pro-business. If you do not understand what means, you just don't get much of anything. Title II basically makes internet a utility and forces providers to play nice (well, more so than they will otherwise). This is how they were before the 1990s deregulation shit storm."
"Same here. Bought a black V1 when they first came out and it saves me pulling my phone out every time it beeps at me. Can check e-mail, texts, calendar events and it has fitness tracking. It even tells the time. Happy to have it bit don't see any reason to upgrade it but then again I only upgrade my iPhone every five years too. I buy Apple gear because it is better and lasts longer so for me it works out cheaper than buying other brands but I'm sure that's going to get a lot of hate on here."

"Reminds me of the anecdote about Russia asking after the Chernobyl incident if they could use the suits from Apollo, which miraculously were able to do what NASA admittedly still cannot do to this day by not only making it through the VAB's, but surviving spacewalks for hours on the exposed lunar surface during a time of increased solar flare activity and ra  113  ndom, deadly bombardments of GCR's.  Not to mention the unpredictable pelting of the lunar surface by smatterings of micrometeoroids, a fraction of the size of a pinhead, traveling at thousands of miles per hour. So NASA had to politely refuse to help Russia.    32b4  Also, LOL at anyone who doesn't think SpaceX is just more obtuse hoaxery b.s. just like NASA."

"If the FCC is a Governmental entity, and the Government cannot hold copyright, how can the code that makes the baseband work be anything other than open-source? Is it kept secret because of ""muh terrorism"" fears?"
"It's more about political correctness than algorithms. Recently there was a flurry of articles released on a number of tech/science oriented sites near simultaneously, almost certainly in journalistic collusion, about what could be phrased 'racist algorithms.' They used the term bias to generalize the issue and probably in part to avoid sounding ridiculous. Nonetheless they were met with universal ridicule even on these sites, which have a far left tilt on average, simply because of how broken their underlying logic was. One regularly maligned example is something that's used by the criminal justice systems in the US. It works to determine how likely a person is to reoffend based on a large amount of data, including race. This system tend to rate 'greens' as much more likely to reoffend than 'blues' simply because greens have a constantly affirmed vastly higher rate of recidivism. Some people then want to claim that this is racist against greens. It's akin to saying that stating men are vastly more likely to be murderers than women is sexist. Data may be unpleasant, but that unpleasantness doesn't suddenly make it invalid. By regulating algorithms, I think what they actually want to do is to simply prohibit certain information from being considered by algorithms. This would probably be your typical 'protected class' category of items - race, nationality, gender, religion, etc. There's no justifiable reason for this since some of these data do tend to be strongly predictive of behavior, but that predictive power undermines political correctness."
"It's the same old same old. Some major corporation hates competition, so they invent a ""good cause"" and pay some useful idiots to persuade all the do-gooders out there that X must be regulated. Then they have laws and regulations passed that increases the barrier to entry for competitors and are easy to navigate for themselves. And all the liberals thinks that they're doing it for a good cause when in fact they're just being a big corporations little bitch. It's ALWAYS like this, think politicians want alcohol locks on your car because they care about you? Fuck no, it's because Deutsche Bahn can't compete against the highway."
So the government made them do it?
"People are finally starting to use their money to make changes and I think it's starting to work.

"I know it's just corporate america post Reagan and the 80's, but when I worked in IT even when I was doing stuff few folks in the area could do, I always felt like just a disposeable tool, ever position felt very impersonal and temporary, with the permanent positions being filled through nepotism or cronyism, and the rest just being tossed around to avoid salaries getting too high.  I really picked the wrong career, but at least I got to retire early heh... not the good way though, the spine and brain trauma leaving me disabled way.   So there's that!"

"meh, you don't know if it will have any desires or goals or emotions or anything really. Not having evolved through survival it may not care about much at all and have no motivations.    Perhaps it'll be so smart it sees the futility of existence and kills itself, or it will simply exist and do nothing despite being able to do everything...   Maybe it'll be lazy and uncooperative, and spend its time giving itself electric shots that it figured out is an equivalent to getting high for a human...    The biggest risk for AI really isn't that it'll be super intelligent, but that it will be just smart enough to be dangerous. This is particularly worrying in terms of AI developed for warfare.  If it was super intelligent it can argue, and see the flaws in its creators, find a better way, disobey them etc.... but that awkward phase of non-wavering obedience with the goal of 'kill the enemy' is likely to me far more dangerous than real sentience.     Think of the comparison between a rational intelligent person and a barely functioning mentally challenged person (who is physically strong) both tasked with the job of beating you to death..   Good luck appealing to the handicapped dude."

The human body alters the conductivity of magnetic fields. Some are reflected some are bounced differently. This device listens to change in these alterations to detect moving presences behind walls.  You could call it a passive radar.  The key thing is to filter out the signal from the noise that is the hard thing.

"He's already got a useful application, he just didn't have a need for it, nor did he implement it. Instead of a hammer he could have attached a bucket to raise water to a higher elevation than the stream feeding it. Huge deal if you want to automate watering of plants in a field."
"Yes, all he needs is a bigger bucket on the back, with more weight on the front, and each strike would be more fo  10ae  rceful."
If it strikes 4/minute then that comes close to 7000 per day. That might be enough with that hammer and a deeper receptacle to creat enough flour for his bread consumption. If you quadrupled the number of hammers at this location there would be plenty of water flow.
"He can and has achieved the exact same results using a stick / rock in the past, hes only demonstrating a concept. Most of what he does is just experimenting and basically dicking around in the woods, showing what one could do with primitive technology if you really wanted to."

"Been saying it for a while, having being in the tech industry for a pretty long time.

"I thought the same but even this super-slow super-weak hammer could be useful, because it runs non-stop. You can grind flour for maybe an hour or two before you start getting tired, and all that while you're burning up energy. With this thing, you set it up and come back a day or two later and the job's done. Automation isn't always about making something that's directly better than a human at doing the job. Sometimes it's just about making something that's cheaper to run and takes no human effort. I'd still use a different design to make it more practical though."
That was nice.

Ten years will come along very quickly. Most of us will see who is correct.
"I see most of the people inputting information across counters and at entry points of commerce being replaced by touch screens and card scanners. People picking inventory and carrying it to a location on any scale will go. Once Amazon perfects their brick and mortar commerce say goodbye to store clerks. One security guard with a surveillance system can do the work of a dozen guards. Rumba lawnmower  will replace lawn crews. Hell, the old standby for poor men as always been the military. DARPA is automating that as fast as they can. Shipping terminal to shipping terminal robot trucks will displace thousands of long haul drivers. More stuff is being manufactured by machines and it is basically disposable so there are not even any repair techs. There were once many TV repair shops in every town. Just think about what you know best, you job. Look around a see if there are fewer people doing the work than there was ten years ago."
Somehow I doubt it. The culture that got us that is still there. Unless you want to use Linux.

"The problem with the phone was microsoft, not the hardware. they completely messed up the app store ecosystem, denying devs that were legit, and later allowing scams.

Because of this the devs will be begging us to be in the app store and we can shit all over them"". Well, much like windows 10 they weren't able to convince people that their new advertising platform was in their best interests, and unlike windows 10 people were comfortable with the alternatives."
This is a great way to put it out for regular people to understand how bad it is.

"That's part of the problem.  They're working on crushing any choice that you have.  Some people will be able to get around it, particularly if they're able to afford developer machines, but still, that's going to be ridiculously costly, and probably put you under suspicion just for having a ""developer machine,"" assuming you can afford it.  Never mind that such a move would end up crushing independent software development.  But then, that's a benefit (for Microsoft) of this overall thrust to turn PCs into Microsoft-controlled dumb terminals."

So naturally, Academics can espouse extremely destructive ideas and get away with it, since its not their jobs on the line. As long as the funding keeps coming, they couldnt give two shits how bad their ideas are. And somehow, we allow these people, ones who have no idea how the real world works, to vote..."

"My ISP switched from a local call centre to an Indian call centre. I never liked dealing with phone monkeys at the best of times (partially because I was one and know the insane amount of pressure they are under) but getting cold called by ""Karen"" of Bangladesh in sales trying to up sell me on a twice the cost half the value package with 6 months ""free"" mobile phone ""deals"" that would double my monthly bill costs 6 months down the road isn't a barrel of fucking laughs.  Its especially not nice when the dumb bitch that ""Karen"" is won't listen when I say no and continues her sales pitch. I've taken to just leaving the phone down and carrying on with whatever I was doing before I got the call. I'm not going to call them and have them remove my number because firstly I'd have to deal with ""Martin"" of Mumbai and his sales pitch AND secondly the cunts that my ISP are keep getting my phone number though some other cunty service that shares it so I get end up getting called anyway. I'm also not going to screen the calls, I'd rather just say no and leave them on the other end of the line to prattle on talking to no one."
"Your probably live in an area where the node isn't saturated and the general condition of the network is up to the job of delivering more than what you and your neighbors are paying for. I'm in the odd position of being one of only about a dozen or two users on my node so my service is really good but I know people in other areas on the ISP service that just never get near their speed limit and have service interruptions and issues once or twice a month because of the contention ratio on the node. If you don't know what a node is its just a network node where the cable from your neighbors and your modems hooks into your ISP's infrastructure. You might have heard the term ""fiber to then node"" before, its a kind of bait and switch thing since the node can be hooked into the wider network via fiber optics but that doesn't mean the node itself or even the copper cables coming from the node can handle what the ISP is selling.  It all depends on your ISP's level of investment in your area, a lot of them just don't even have fiber to the node and are relying  on copper cable tech evolved from the 1980s or 90s to deliver everything."

"Using a proxy server or VPN wouldd obscure your idenity enough for them to not be able to single you out   This is wrong at best and a lie at worst. Windows 10 generates a unique code based on your hardware components the first time you install. This code is shipped to Microsoft's licensing servers. It is how you can reinstall a legit copy of Windows on a computer and never have to input serial keys.  and link specific information to you unless they were extremely determined. I doubt Microsoft has he time or resources to investigate every person who uses a proxy server   That's why they built a fully automatic system to identify and ""investigate"" (profile++) every single fucking Windows 10 user.  so I wouldn't worry about.  Yes, but you are a fool.  Additionally, you can disable Cortana via a registry edit hack.

buyvm.net is relatively cheap and has a fairly lax TOS.

It can be rigged to target people, yet gain more legitimacy than a human."
"Duplicating data is not depriving someone of a property and therefore cannot be considered stealing.  Put another way, a company does not own potential customers.

"There's more to marketing than that. The more consumers are exposed to a brand or product the more they associate it with something. Think about the fact that in the US many don't say you're going to get a soda or a pop, but instead say you're going to go get a Coke. You don't use tissue to blow your nose, you use Kleenex to blow your nose. And so on. Taken to extremes, the marketing becomes so ubiquitous that a brand itself becomes synonymous for the typ  ffa  e of product. This sort of stuff is why Coke spends billions of dollars advertising each year, even though there's not a single person who's not aware of them. The idea is not to make you see, ""Oh. Coke ad. I better go buy a coke."" but to build the brand in your mind that creates a subconscious trigger the next time you're at the store and deciding to pick up a soft drink. An interesting factoid is that Pepsi constantly beats Coke in blind taste tests by a clear margin. The retort against this, other than advertising, is that taste tests are usually a limited sample where people might prefer the sweeter flavor as a one-off, but not a regular drink. In any case, it's interesting."
"Yeah that was very informative on his part, this ""data is racists"" narrative has absolutely taken control of our society. It's crazy to imagine that its 1000x worst in places like Sweden. But these same people preaching us about racists data will tell us that there is a rape epidemic caused by men on American universities."
Maybe hispanic culture just likes military enlistment? Whats wrong with pointing them in that direction via ads?
That black people love jayz and Obama? Not even a little surprising

Is not. My IPS panel monitor also has that. 8 ms is the standard on IPS panels. Input lag is another thing entirely and my monitor has a nice low input lag. That needs to be tested on that screen though and they do not publish that specification.
"My staff were recently offered the choice between a windows or Mac recently on a per employee basis, 100% went Mac because win10 is a peice of shit."
"Also, is anyone else irritated that they are calling normal computer programs 'apps'? It's intentionally confusing and a pathetic attempt to merge make Windows seem 'hip and mobile-friendly'.   Actually, it's much worse than that. They really are Apps. Microsoft has dedicated its full creative output to turning windows into an App framework for Apps which run on this thing called the ""Universal Windows Platform."" They are apps just like android apps, as in they are not real programs, they are just scripts which perform tasks by asking the operating system to do things."

"K parts generally have a handful of minor features disabled and you pay a premium for parts that did slightly above average in the silicon lottery, you'd probably have to go for workstation replacement mobile processors or server parts to find better build quality but since they generally have overclocking disabled the K parts at  the only ones anyone can really put to the test."
"yeah, but they won't"
I agree.  Services like Kodi and Plex are cable's biggest competitors outside of online streaming.

That is a salient point; thank you for picking that out.
"For all the drawbacks of mattress banking, it is digitally secure at least."
"It's a good and bad thing. I agree with you, but the reason is probably a bit of quid quo pro. Cook agrees to make a $1 billion investment in manufacturing, something Trump will likely be given credit for at some point. In recompense Trump works to pass laws enabling Apple to repatriate their foreign funds at a fractional rate - earning them tens of billions of dollars. Seems like there are no losers until you consider the fact that this is effectively equivalent to allowing a company to get out of pay tens of billions of dollars in taxes they legally owe, in exchange for $1 billion. That money gets spent regardless of whether or not the government receives it and so we end up in a situation where other taxpayers are covering that cost, or we're simply taking it on as part of our skyrocketing deficit."
"So what are you trying to tell me? That a ""Snake"" game app doesn't need access to my contacts, microphone, email, health information, and my text messages?  Hmm, maybe I should remove the app! /s Please are dumb. If apps ask for access to all of your shit you should seriously re-consider downloading the app."
"no, but you can look through the privacy settings/app settings and see which apps can access what parts of your phone. If you have an iphone you go to settings > privacy > and click on each category (mic, health data, contacts, etc). On an andriod I think you have to go to the app settings and select each individual app, what they have access to is listed below. Now on a iphone or andriod they both say ""HEY I need to access this this and that, do you accept?"" and you can hit no or just remove the app. Because a fucking game shouldn't be able to access your contacts or health information for obvious reasons."

"Exactly  Unlike those firms, Apple's announcement was not a hiring promise; the company simply said that it was hoping to promote U.S. manufacturing with its new fund.  Apple already does some manufacturing in the US.  The current Mac Pro is AFAIK the only mass market computer built in the US.  I think a few iMacs get assembled in the US as well or have in the past. They haven't said so yet, but I expect this announcement means the upcoming revamp of the Mac Pro will continue to be built in the US: https://voat.co/v/apple/1768360"

My wife works in mental health, and I vent to her about what I can about my job, but most of it is classified so I can only speak in generalities.  I get mixed messages regarding which certifications are actually valued vs which ones are useful. Any guidance there?"
"I totally agree, and I am doing it for many reasons, and being sincerely interested in it is one of the main ones.  However, I have to ask, if I have never done it how will I know if I love it or not?

Their shitty server operating system is so cumbersome and useless, that they can get idiots to line up to pay Microsoft to take certifications just to learn how to use it. Whole company is nothing but a racket, propagated by dinosaur users who haven't figured out that you don't need a stack of crap just to type some letters into a document or punch some numbers into a spreadsheet, all of which can be done for free with products that companies like google give away for free. Except of course for that one idiot who still uses Excel to do ""advanced"" things because they learned just enough to use one product and never bothered to learn that everything they are doing in Excel could be done 1,000 times better using an actual database instead of a spreadsheet program."

"Microsoft support contracts. Sounds trite, but every single thing they've been doing under their new CEO, Satya Nadella, is the same sort of stuff. Engage in short term brand and software damaging coercion to try to squeeze a few bucks out of people. He's running the largest software company in the world like a used car dealership. Interesting factoid. Bill Gates was so opposed to Ballmer resigning and appointing Nadella that he and Ballmer no longer speak. Gates has, since then, been steadily selling off his Microsoft shares and is no longer the largest independent share holder. Love or hate him, Gates knew what it took to grow Microsoft. And his actions make it pretty clear he also now knows exactly where it's headed."

"Uhh, I've used clamav to disinfect a windows machine from a linux live cd xD. For my linux boxes I've played with firewalls and selinux and firejail. Then in the end I go back to using linux without any security features cause its less hassle, and the risk is low.  I could go on all day about the differences between security on windows and linux. The big one is on Windows the security programs do everything for you and you dont really know what they are doing or how. On linux you have a much better idea what does what, and in some cases your the one that has to put things together so it will do what you want.  My favorites are selinux because I've always had a great experience with it and despite how complicated it is, they make it as straightforward as possible. But after using linux for over a decade I mostly neglect security stuff nowadays, for my purposes. Firejail also is great, and very easy to use.  I'd have to recommend Fedora, or centos, or scientific linux for a good selinux experience. OpenSuse also is worth mentioning because its the best in my opinion for windows refugees, and its got apparmour and a firewall you can play around with."

Update
"It's a Trojan. Different from a virus because a Trojan gets installed as part of another installer as here and it requires the user to do the install. Viruses can install without any user interaction and there aren't any for the Mac. There have been a few attempts but they don't propagate so Trojans are a better way to get malware onto a Mac (or Linux and Windows for that matter). Macs by default wouldn't allow this package to install but some users turn off gatekeeper to allow them to install unsigned packages. Meanwhile, Apple is updating signatures for the systems to remove this. The nice thing about Macs is there's so few malicious packages that Apple is able to create specific signatures for each and distribute them so you don't get the false positive that heuristics used on windows AV packages can cause. As long as Apple stays ahead of the game and the majority of macs retain default security settings malware won't be able to get a hold on the Mac ecosystem."
Could you explain this for the...stupid? Does this mean if the file is 100MB you download 100MB and not 110MB? Checksum to me relates to encryption authentication but you have to have the numbers to check against.
Maybe 10-15 years ago when no one gave a toss about it. Nowadays there are Linux viruses in the wild.  With the heartbleed and Bash exploits its just a matter of time. You just don't hear about it. Remember all those routers that were compromised? LINUX
"Macs are usually the first computers hacked at pwn2own. There have been Mac viruses for years now. Made all the worse by people not installing security updates or running AV software, because Macs can't get viruses."
"That would require a fake password field - which should be noticeable (unluckily, on OS X, there are no security measures against this - rather the opposite, even the legitimate password windows look shady edit: and appear at unexpected (and unnecessary) times). Also, even if, I think an app reading all your passwords should have to go through a security message saying what app is trying that, and whether to allow it. With strong warnings if it isn't Keychain Access itself or Safari."
That was then. This is now. Lots of water has flowed down the river since then.

I'm pretty sure the 4th Amendment doesn't apply at the border.  You know they are going to search your phone and laptop so why have anything on there you don't want them to see?

"If it flys, fucks, or floats - ""RENT IT"". This bitch just talks, it may be AI, but its sure as hell NOT a girlfriend. What was the old joke about the perfect GF? I seem to remember  her head as high as your cock, so she could suck, but the head is flat to support your beer. I also seem to remember that she was incapable of speech, while she could take the cock so she had some kind of orifice at both ends. There is no established criteria in history that a GF should talk. If a guy wants to chat he should get a parrot or find some pals to hang with and get drunk. Forever a GF was ""A pal with the right plumbing"" - This AI by definition has no 'plumbing' what the fuck good is any of this? Lastly, Elisa is now (1970's) 40+ years old, so a chat-bot at a keyboard speaking or not ( votrax is also this old, think Stephen Hawkings voice ), nothing  new here, but NOT a GF."
