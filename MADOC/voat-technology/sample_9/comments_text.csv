Doesn't Mint have systemd though?
"I tried pale moon for a while, but it was buggy and lacked some basic features I wanted (forget what exactly, it was a while back). IceCat was all but unusable what with throwing a hissy fit every time a website used non-free software. I ditched it pretty quickly. I tried brave back in it's infancy but it was quite buggy. It might be better now though. I vaguely remember trying qupzilla and midori, they didn't work very well. Haven't tried doobie, might give it a go."
"This comment wasn't about the content of TFA. It was about the form. That said: There is an argument to be made for thermal compounds in regards to long term thermal stress. Modern energy saving tech puts a lot of thermal stress on the connection between die and casing, in the form of rapid temperature changes, and liquid thermal compounds are much more resistant to this sort of stress than solid solder."

"Since v18 Mint now uses systemd. This is because Mint is based on Ubuntu and Ubuntu went to systemd. You'd have to use v17 or prior. I had lots of issues with 17, especially when trying to upgrade the kernel or get nvidia prime/bubblebee to work correctly."
Link to Windows version of IceCat. For Linux check to see if it's available in your repos. It's also available from F-Droid for Android. Highly recommend disabling LibreJS to make it usable.

"They found that Nintendo infringed US Patent No. 6,864,796, first filed in 1999, which describes ""systems and methods for evaluating movement of a body relative to an environment.""  What, to you, is written there that explicitly defines how that works? This is not how patents are supposed to work. Also, 1999. Cell phones didn't come standard (if at all) with camera sensors in 1999."
"I've never had any issues with systemd personally, but I've always liked the linux philosophy of everything does 1 thing really well, and systemd seems more like a windows concept of do a whole bunch of shit so that when it breaks it breaks everything."

"Reality is that Google heavily donates to both Republicans and Democrats.      https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000067823  Their top donations are 1.5 million to hrc (from individuals), over a third of a million to bernie (from individuals), nearly a million to ""My Ride To Vote"", which gives drives voters to the polling booths, over half a million to ""DNC Services Corp"", which I am sure is exactly what the name says, and half a million each to the Cleveland and Philadelphia host committees.    So of those donations, half a million went to the Republican National Convention, exactly matched by the Democratic National Convention-  meanwhile, all individuals were donating heavily to Democrat politicians and various left wing operative groups that bus people to polls.  Hopefully to just one polling place per person, but like...    Anyway, doesn't sound extremely neutral to me."

Lo and behold, they are facing bankruptcy, and their only ""Hope"" is to sell everything off to India. I hope these company executives get sued and thrown in jail for such behavior."

It's entirely possible there is something in there (like an MFD) that is running Windows. I worked avionics on the B-52H and the MFDs that were installed for the targeting pod ran Windows. I think it was XP.

"I didn't read their blog but I did read the post.   ""The thing is, after registering a notification routine for loaded PE images with the kernel, the callback may receive invalid image names. After digging into the matter, what started as a seemingly random issue proved to originate from a coding error in the Windows kernel itself.""  And   Essentially, malware can use the above API to trick the OS into giving malware scanners other files – such as benign executables – to inspect rather than their own malicious code.  But this callback, without reading the documentation and just using the article, is only returning executables running in memory. Antivirus can scan files not running in memory. It seems reading this short article that at best it can prevent an antivirus from identifying the process by name in memory. If it can even properly spoof the name. I swear I had seen this somewhere else and the article just said that they were sometimes getting back garbage so it wouldn't even necessarily be a valid target for scanning.  Maybe the blog has more information but this sounds pretty benign from this article."

"Your Core i7 can read and execute the 8085 instruction set, and the 8085 isn't really a rare chip yet. There are also numerous old computer museums that have computers even older than this, including valve computers, like the Colossus. For archival purposes, I'd worry more about the sheer volume of modern data and the inability to recreate web applications once the requisite underlying APIs rot away. You and I can boot up some old game in an emulator, but how will future generations get to see what the early web was like? And though I haven't finished the video yet, I would think the Smithsonian would have people better than this; it's an eighty-eighty-five, not an eight-zero-eight-five, damnit. And he doesn't appear to know what the chips do, as the infographic points to the monitor ROM when he describes the keyboard controller, and he describes a ""74LS"" chip, even though it's the numbers that come after the LS that describe what that particular chip does. And he has six seven-segment displays, not six-segment displays."

That's what I came to mention. Don't you know oil is bad and electricity is generated by magic? It's basically a free lunch. These same retards in Priuses think hunting is wrong and food should only come from the grocery so no animals were harmed.
"It's hard to get solid numbers on this. US coal power plants generate about 1.09 kWh per pound of coal Burning 1 pound of coal generates on average of 2.19 pounds of CO2 So that gives us 2.19/1.09 = 2.0092 pounds of CO2 per kWh Tesla claims 0.320 kWh/mile of energy (85kWh/265 miles) which seems to jive with real world numbers reported by users. Charging efficiency is hard to pinpoint but 90% is probably doable (I've seen Tesla claims of 93%) Assume 90% efficiency for the electrical grid  (US average is actually 95.3%) Which gives us 0.320/0.9/0.9 * 2.19/1.09 = 0.7937 pounds of CO2/mile Burning gasoline generates about 19.6 pounds of CO2 per gallon A car that gets 35 miles per gallon then produces 1/35 * 19.6 = 0.56 pounds of CO2 per mile A car that gets 25 miles per gallon produces  1/25*19.6 = 0.7840 pounds of CO2 per mile So on the surface a car that gets more the 25 miles per gallon should produce less CO2 emissions per mile than an electric car using power generated solely by coal.   However the return on energy investment for gasoline is about 20% worse than coal (it requires more energy to produce 1kWh of gasoline vs 1kWh of coal).  Assuming that energy comes from fossil fuels as well it bumps the carbon out of the gasoline cars 20% so you would need a car that gets ~ 30miles/gallon to match the Tesla.  But then you could argue you need to include the energy used to produce the battery packs, etc, etc. The real answer though is not to use coal to generate your electricity.  China is currently at ~70% coal but is actively pursuing Nuclear, Wind, Hydro and  Solar generation.  Even at 70% coal production this pushes the electric equation to the better side."

"I firmly believe that feudalism is innate to human society; there's no escaping it. The other component is religion.    The warlords of the past grabbed wealth, and then looked to priests to give them divine sanction.  Some warlords combined the two functions into one.  Today the warlords are the corporations and they look to useful idiots like SJWs for divine sanction."

"China is currently the world leader in solar. They have ~290GWh of solar installed as of today and that is increasing rapidly. A large part of this is certainly about the environment. Their cities with their unbreatheable air are a stark reminder of what happens when you have insufficient environmental concern in your national policy. At the same time this is also largely driven by the fact that the US economy is largely supported by the petrodollar.  The petrodollar only has value when fossil fuels are in large usage. This is, for instance, why the US is doing things like supporting an oil pipeline to transport oil sands that are so expensive to mine that they were recently being sold at a loss. And why our oil producing lapdogs like Saudi Arabia are not really upset that we're trying to tank the price of oil. Oil needs to stay below the price of renewables, or the petro dollar will collapse in on itself. Each country that removes their dependence on fossil fuels indirectly weakens the US economy in that our money might actually begin to need to stand on its own merit. Right now we don't have to worry about that. Thanks to some prescient deals in the 70s the vast majority of oil is still pegged to the dollar, and these countries reinvest their surplus oil revenue into US securities. So imagine what happens if we print a trillion dollars. Naturally there would be inflation. But when there's inflation that means other countries need to acquire more USD for the same amount of oil. The oil producing countries then end up reinvesting what's left over of that US currency into US securities. The net result? When we have inflation USD is more rapidly taken out of the economy and, like magic, that inflation starts to reverse. This is a large part of the reason why the US can arbitrarily ""print money"" (not how money is made... but that's another topic) with 0 immediate economic consequences."

"If every vehicle is ... electric, you've just moved your bottleneck to the power grid.  But you end up with one supply chain's overhead to deal with, rather than a dozen supply chains for petroleum alone. You can make huge investments in the centralized generation end of electric power (improving ""greenness"", efficiency, changing what you use to generate it, whatever) without requiring slow adoption by consumers, while also taking advantage of the growing amount of local small scale generation through wind and solar. You can't make meaningful changes to the fuel (without killing off the vehicles) in the case of petroleum based fuels. With electricity, you can do whatever you want with however it is generated without impacting the delivered power. That would be attractive for a society moving forward technologically."

"I dont think it is. Its 1 of 3 existing credit score companies. If it leaves, we end up with the centralized power of credit monitoring to only 2 companies. Hardly a better outcome. Just like when people say Microsoft is dying. They may be truly unethical companies, but they wont be dying any time soon."
"If you have a bunch of fuel types it means reduced use for each (raising price) and the store needing a bigger footprint to sell all of it raising their overhead and thus their prices. The Gas/Diesel situation is very similar for the station so minimal footprint add and the addition of diesel brings in commercial so is worth the addition of one type. If we had Ethanol, gas, propane, diesel you would have many places that would opt out of one or two and a nightmare for some to find the right fill station when traveling. I expect propane would continue to be the one to suffer. Ethanol all I really know is from hearing from others, it is used in flex fuels and if they get any water in them they are really not happy about it and run like crap."
"You end up building your own hybrid in a zombie situation put a gas/diesel generator in the trunk take off the trunk lid and drive until you are at 1/4 then start generator and drive till full then turn off generator and repeat.  The bigger boxy self driving room you sit in layout works for electric as you could have the roof be all solar to help with that during the day and the larger flat top layout complements solar panels. That is what I want for a self driving car, the room thing electric or not matters less, I can go to bed in it on friday after work sleep for 8-10 hours get up 3 states away and have a Saturday crash in a hotel Saturday night spend most of Sunday there and then the car drives me back that night while I sleep get home shower and go to work. A full 2 days anywhere within 8 hours drive of home on a normal weekend. Road trips would be very different if you could spend a full day then travel all night to the next location an just need to find showers along the way, Imagine spending a 10 day vacation and every day could be a different location up to 8 hours apart no long drive making you tired as that happens while you are sleeping, get stuck in construction who cares you set your alarm by GPS instead of time."
"Sell electric only in 2040, then 2042/2043 a bunch of them hit the used marked from off lease, then in 2045 the used market will really get going so by 2050 they should start being the primary and then gas stations become rarer leading to more people swapping over for the convenience and savings. Maybe convenience stores would start being stores fist and gas second leading to realistic prices instead of ripoffs but convenient as you already stopped there, more likely restaurants would add charging stations and it would be bad news for fast food may as well have a fresh cooked meal instead of reheated frozen if you are going to be there for 30-45 minutes anyhow. That is the timetable in my head based on no facts or figures that can be cited (well other then 2 year leases are a thing I could cite)."

"As far as I know, anyone who had an Equifax credit score. So almost anyone who ever had a house load, car loan, or credit card. If you pay any type of utility (or rent) where you needed a credit check first, chances are when you pay those bills they are reported to Equifax. So if you fall into any of those categories, your data was probably part of the leak. There are two other another credit score services (TransUnion and Experian) and occasionally some of the things I mentioned are only reported to one service (in which case I believe it is possible to have a credit score without having an Equifax ""account"") but that's very rare.

"I posted a lot more information about the research this is based on in another submission here. The incredibly interesting thing is that it wasn't determining sexuality based on what you'd think of as sexual cues. It was determining it for men by examining mostly their nose, eyes, eyebrows, cheeks, hairline and chin. For women it was the the nose, mouth corners, hair and neckline that played key roles. This doesn't necessarily mean it's only looking at genetic factors. Your lifestyle and decisions are reflective in your physical appearance. For instance a very obvious thing is that an obese person is going to have less self control and a more self indulgent personality. Or a person with cauliflower ear is probably athletic and likely trained in some form of martial art. These are very simple first-degree factors, but ultimately there are countless things we do that affect our body in various ways and while humans may not be able to pick up on the more subtle of these signals (and they may be entirely nonsensical from our perspective) - AIs can pick up on them."

"exactly.  The DNC leak was an inside job, the actual digital evidence essentially proves this. Russia had jack shit to do with that. Everything they have presented thus far came from a questionable analysis by an involved 3rd party (on the payroll) and has never been independently verified - in fact, the DNC went out of their way to ensure this would never happen by requesting the 3rd party destroy any digital evidence and invalidate any kind of chain of custody.  There is zero evidence of any kind of state actor accessing the individual voting systems or machines, or altering the tally in any way Every single country in the first world attempts to ""sway"" elections to be favorable to their international goals. They do this through slanted media and statements by government officials. We do that to, it's called ""being a country with international interests"".

"Qi is an air-core transformer, the same as any Tesla coil; As opposed to Tesla's designs (unlimited free energy, everywhere at all times), Qi provides only as much power as you need exactly where you need it; Qi field is only active when a Qi-compliant receiver is in proximity to the device; Qi charging is near-field - that is to say that the EM fields generated by the charger can not be detected more than a couple inches from the device, and then, only by specifically designed, highly sensitive equipment used in a controlled environment; Through use of shielding and the shape of the coils themselves, the magnetic field created by the charger is ""shaped"" such that it extends only into the designated charging area for the mating device; With the primary coil (charger) being magnetically coupled to the secondary (receiver), leakage is minimal;  Source: I work for an automotive supplier in an R&D facility where we are developing Qi charging for current (2018) higher-end model cars, and for general roll-out in most vehicles by the 2020s.  Qi charging is certainly less polluting than, say, wi-fi or cell signals. The frequencies used do not lend well to EM propagation (kilohertz instead of mega- or gigahertz). A Qi charger probably emits less EM noise than plugging a 5V USB charger into your wall and hooking your phone up to that. Most rechargeable devices are going to be using the Qi specification in the not-too-distant future, and by 2030, the concept of having to carry around (or otherwise keep available) various cords and adaptors in order to charge a phone will seem as quaint as we consider carrying a lantern."

"In this application, the truck will essentially be under a heavy load and using the electric motors to brake the entire way down to the lower elevation, which is expected to generate a surplus of 10 kWh of electricity with each roundtrip it takes.

The entire eletrical needs for the entire planet was meetable with some rather small area shown on a map in the Saharan desert. Panels have gained quite a significant efficiency jump since then so that total area has shrank.

"Part of the reason laws look so inscrutable is that the average layperson doesn't have the full context when looking at something. Eg, you might not register a difference between ""dwelling"" and ""premises"" if the two are never right next to each other, but the difference would easily be crucial to a statute regarding the relationship between a landlord and his tenant; the same goes with the named laws: it may well have been amended to the point of needing a new name without ever actually getting one.

But if you had robots doing these jobs, you can cut every kitchen cook in your stores. Workers are the most expensive part of your business, especially with taxes, insurance, etc. So why in the hell would a business owner spend money on the robots AND hire more people? They wouldn't.

"They will definitely retrofit some aircraft with glass. They already add a tablet to the EFB for checklists and pilot convenience. So glass is now the standard and maintaining the old systems is expensive. Also many of those control consoles require heavy and expensive 'head end' units in the EE bay that you don't see. If you take into account weight/fuel savings for the remaining life of the aircraft, and the shedding of old maintenance for instrumentation and control systems that have been deprecated and require specialists from a small pool to service - retrofit becomes attractive. Because cockpit instrumentation remains very standard compared to other systems on an aircraft across an entire platform - glass retrofits can be standardized and the STC process can be cookie cutter. The FAA will also ease some of the rules due to the data presented in the article suggesting that glass is safer. They will never hang their asses out for voluntary cost-saving retrofits unless they can protect themselves with the fact that the intent was to increase safety."

"Linux is a pretty decent operating system if you're able to get it configured to your liking. However, Lenovo making such ""secret deals"" doesn't bother me as I can't stand the company. My wife, for whatever reason, swears by Lenovo but her last laptop was from the company and both of the hinges broke, ensuring that the screen couldn't stay up at all and ended up hanging by a wire. It was the result of the company using the same kind of cheap, hard plastic that Chrysler uses in its cars. She bought another Lenovo, but I insisted that she get one with reinforced hinges."

"You don't get it.  Technically speaking, offering 25 is much more difficult than 10. This is due to the nature of the technology available for residential wired internet.  So if you incentivize them to meet the ""Broadband goal"" you also have to make it possible to succeed.  A technically literate person defined it as 10mb, and a fucking clueless idiot politician defined it as 25mb. You will end up with more people with good internet this way.  The difference between 10 and 25 is not nearly as significant as the difference between 1 and 10. You can't re-legislate the 1990's. The US is clearly setting a policy of focusing on higher bandwidth mobile for the 10gb speeds of the future.  This is not a bad decision for a large, largely low-density country.  Higher-speed wired infrastructure like you describe is good for dense cities and in the cities in the USA you can get those speeds. I get 300mb in NYC for a normal price, for example."

"But of course even the ""threat to life"" standard doesn't pass the Fourth Amendment test without probable cause and a warrant, and should result in charges being dismissed if they stem from the information gained.  The thing is... if a cell provider voluntarily gives your data over, there's no violation of the Fourth Amendment. And they are likely to do so since they don't really care about you... And also because apparently anything you share with another business isn't protected by the 4th amendment, and becomes grabbable by the state without a warrant, even if both parties want to keep it secret.

They were caught trying to penetrate three elections. All of the attacks lead back to DHS or the CIA.
I remember a few of the states that were hacked said the hack came from DHS when they traced it.  They fucking hacked themselves in order to create russia narrative.  Remember CIA can mask their work to look like it came from anywhere.

"From what I know Purism said the Librem 5 would be able to support any Linux distro, so if their campaign succeeds.. the postmarketOS would be able to run on the phone no problem."

Personally I prefer the screen buttons to the hardware buttons because my physical buttons tend to fail on me whereas the screen practically never dies - and it also gives the added benefit of being able to move those buttons around, changing their function, etc. by user preference or app context extremely easy. Also I love my clicky mechanical keyboard at home, but the tiny membrane crap they ship with phones was terrible.

"Me neither. It's crazy. When I visit other people where they watch TV, it is always amazing how much time they waste watching commercials. Before Ronald Reagan, there were regulations on how many minutes of commercial time a station could run per hour. I think it was nine minutes. That was plenty. He removed that regulation and many others and sold the TV networks to giant conglomerates. Today, I think stations run about 18 minutes of commercials per hour plus in-program promos that never seem to end."

"This is actually a very useful feature: without it, you need to have somebody physically present if you're doing anything requiring a reboot or shut down and even then you need to wait until the OS loads and the remote management initializes(which, of course, can go wrong in and of itself). Having this sort of contraption means you can do anything with just a network connection, even if the OS doesn't load or if the machine's powered off. The problem comes from the fact that it's impossible to truly disable. I can get leaving the option out of the BIOS to stop some nitwit from breaking a corporate setup, but there should at least be a jumper for home systems."

"Both had best stay in those ranges until they can do atom by atom assembly accurately. From now on those differences from chips within the same batch will be huge (performance, reliability, OC ability, etc.). Honestly I'd prefer they shift to more photonics instead of this approach. For the same space it carries considerably more data (helps address the problem with the communication circuits having to shrink to atom sized to maintain low latency)."
"Some of this is true but some of it is skewed. Purism's coreboot/libreboot efforts have a roadmap: https://puri.sm/learn/freedom-roadmap/ The Talos is wonderful but far too pricey for almost anybody...and I doubt it's x86 emulation can quite run games very well yet, but I may be wrong there. me_cleaner physically removes most of the ME from the rom image, and doesn't just set the bit to turn it off - by default it just removes stuff which prevents ME from starting. The flag is a nice addition as it is doubly ensured not to function. Fact of the matter is that if you remove computrace, the network stack, and the ME, even if running a nonfree bios, you're super safe, and get to have your cake and eat it too in that you can purchase whatever machine you like best. Furthermore, if you replace the OEM ethernet and wlan cards with something by Atheros, or another that doesn't use a blob for it's firmware, and you're just as safe as using coreboot, with the caveat of having slightly less control and insight into the bios firmware itself. Beyond that it is unlikely any existing backdoors, or the management engines, for that matter, will support those free firmware based network devices as they typically only support Intel's. Coreboot/libreboot friendly thinkpads are always a decent idea, but it should be noted that the Opteron board you suggest probably supports the AMD version of AMT, which to my knowledge has yet to be as thouroughly nerfed as Intels."

"Maybe you are overthinking it. YouTube has a history of pretty poor engineering. Their planners appear to be incapable of thinking things through and making a well-thought-out system. If you have ever tried to actually upload videos to YouTube, the first thing you notice is that key features like viewing a list of your uploads, and enhancing them, are randomly sprinkled through a complicated series of nested menus. I mean, if you set out with a goal of sucking their dick and bowing to ((them))), you'll have a hard time getting to your goal of being a ""cuck"". For example, if you upload a video, YouTube is incapable of adding it to their search index. You have to go to the Google parent company to find the video that you just uploaded 5 minutes ago. As another example, a friend of mine likes watching Minecraft videos. There are Minecrafters who think nothing of spending six hours building some complicated block machine without losing their composure, but lose their temper when confronted with YouTube's user interface. It says something that building a word processor in Minecraft is more relaxing than uploading a fucking video. YouTube appears to have no human factors engineers or systems analysts. This is damning for a software company, but there it is. This appears to be a simple continuation of their inability to plan. They cannot understand how to make software for people, so they have to resort to kluges like turning off major features."

But creative types and others liked the esthetic, weren't technical enough to notice the limitations, and bought into the ecosystem.  Now they've lost their only distinguishing feature and against competitors their prices can't be justified."
"sage insights yet, giants are destroyed within those ecosystems entirely to maintain the #1 giant rule, too. counterintuitive and counterproductive marketed as... intuition"
"Personally I think it looks quite good for the home screen. The issue I think is, are apps going to randomly lose a chunk out of them? If you are browsing the internet and turn the thing to the side will the scroll bar literally disappear? If that's the case then I agree this is beyond retarded. If you designed apps to support the notch, that might be okay, and black bar apps that don't. But then why would app developers want to even support that, especially if this thing only lasts one release."
"Seriously, Jobs was by all accounts a huge asshole and a retard that believe in alternative medicine, but he seemed to hold his employees to very high expectations which allowed Apple to take over the world (figuratively). Probably a good example of why CEO salaries are excessive, because that one person was able to steer the company in the right direction for so long, and his departure has seen an immediate decline."
Globalist Jews own ethnic Jews?
ebay for older 801/802 books was $5.  youtube videos are free.  examcompass practice tests are free (and really helpful).  bought an ebay voucher for $135 (COMPTIA is $205).  I studied for about 3 weeks.
"You can tell the EU politicians have fuck all of a clue how to operate a business. The ""proposals"" they come up with are awful.  A VAT tax(20% on all goods) does nothing but decrease demand for goods, Cap Gain tax on stocks(Sweden) did nothing but destroy their stock market to the point they needed to reverse it(If I have profit from an investment, I now can not put money back into the investment. I need to take it out, declare it, pay taxes on it, and put it back into the fund at a ""Fee""), gender/racial quota systems to make sure any company that makes profits leaves, bankrupt inducing benefit mandates, increasingly progressive tax rates on inheritances(To the tune of 50%+). .Its like these retards want the EU to go completely bankrupt from gross negligence and mismanagement"
"Outsourcing tech jobs to India provides workers that cost 1/3 or 1/2 an American, but they create a fraction of the value that American workers do... between their lower skill levels, barely speaking English, and having work hours that almost completely miss the east coast 9-5, hiring them is a laughable decision."
"Everything since he died has been bloated and overcomplicated, like government capitulating rather than innovating.   Forced to use an ipad for one of my classes.  I get frustrated and irrationally angry every time I try to use the damned thing.  I see MS shit starting to turn the same way.  I just wish Linux was less fiddly and actually worked properly without me having to constantly fix it."
"It is time to burn the place down.  Lol, if antifa keeps going they'll do it to themselves."
They want to be Netflix. They want people to pay them for their content and they want the big media companies to use them as the web distribution platform instead of Netflix & Amazon.
"It's certainly going to kill all the small channels and future channels. Vid.me, Minds.com, & Dtube.video all have tipping mechanisms built in while BitChute.com doesn't pull this shit so Haetron, Paetron, & Paypal links are just fine."
I'm pretty sure they're not going to let you link to twitter.
"Its even worse for Youtube because plenty of Youtubers were also selling merchandise and hawking products for companies. After that you have Patreon, Hatreon, & Minds.com all offering subscription options. Whilte Vid.me & Dtube.video both have tipping features built into their site. Minds.com allows the embedding of content from any of the sites. And BitChute accounts can be set to auto copy videos directly from Youtube accounts. Youtube is fucked once these other guys get their apps on the set top boxes and more Youtubers recommend the alternatives. https://www.bitchute.com/ https://pew.tube/ https://vid.me/ https://dtube.video/"
Several of the Youtubers are mirroring their content across several. ButChute apparently has some feature to link to your Youtube account so it will automatically copy over the videos you upload to Youtube. Then you can upload to vid.me using the link from your Youtube video. So it will copy the video and the description over from Google using their bandwidth. From there its best to look at uploading to Dtube & PewTube. And then post a link to the prefered third part video to Minds.com & Gab. https://www.bitchute.com/ https://pew.tube/ https://vid.me/ https://dtube.video/
"Trump and his teams are having a Greate deal of Trubble shutting down these NWO money laundering Scemes right now, from the Paris Climate deal to Obamacare. We Must focus on a few subjects, take this curruption down one step at a time. The NWO should be treated as a Parasite for what it is and we must deal with it accordingly as Rational dictates of how to deal with Parasites. Youtube is just a bug bite."
"Yeah, it's a momentary craze. : )"
"I don't know, but you'd better be wary of your laptop! dun dun dunnnnnnnn"
Covfefe!
How can you be worse than IME?
Do tell
"they rolled back the switch, i don't think that anything weird is currently running. He did need to do some sort of translation from the new database structure, so maybe that is very expensive, but it seems more like a ddos. also cloudfare has nothing to do with the switch."
"It's short for Dispositions D'ordre Social which, in general IT terms, generally translates to having too many French nationals in the development team and the operating system surrendered in protest."
"Its stickied on the front page, niggerfaggotkike https://voat.co/v/announcements/2165876"
Pretty sure there is a sticky on the front page saying that voat is being DDOSes https://voat.co/v/announcements/2165876
That's implied.
WE WUZ KANGZ OF THE DIVERSITY OFFICE N SHEIT
but will it have a PREMIUM FINISH and a PREMIUM FEEL???  fucking youtube reviewers. fuck them all to hell. damn useless fucking cunts
"It's my new favorite site, and should be yours too."
Word (this is perhaps the most inappropriate use of this 90s affirmation ever!)
"Interesting, thanks for the link"
It's also on Xbox; so probably an app to rent music across all Microsoft platforms.
"A couple months ago I was on an amphetamine binge(nothing new) only this time I had a severe lack of water and got dehydrated but I didn't know I was so. Anyways I tried to take a shit, no go there. Started panicking as it had been 3-4 days. I had to throw on a latex glove with some vasaline and dig that rock hard turd out manual style. Def not a fun experience. It's mentally scarred me. Remeber to stay hydrated on drug binges kidz."
"basically, someone gets a bunch of computers around the world to ask for information from a server, thus making people who actually want to visit the site not be able to connect to the server because it's swamped with requests."
They should release it. Cant get any worse than the warm camel piss it is now
"There are no ""good"" beers that serve the niche of being able to drink a ton of it while mowing your lawn."
"And it's not even a complicated hat, it would be simple to make from scratch and you'd learn a lot more."
"hahaha..however the article is actually puting a driveless car in a dilemma..how should it be programmed we a kid or animal suddenly tries to run pass, should the car hit the kd or shud it just swerve and hit the nearest pole?"
"Yeah same, the only reason I want a new phone is so I can get one that will actually let me root the damn thing, I have a Verizon s5, apparently next to impossible to root, fuck you Samsung and Verizon."
I've yet to meet an app that bogged the cpu / gpu down... it's usually the interface the manufacturer adds that fucks shit up. S5 was the last best flagship phone for me... wish they'd make something like that again.. or just re-release the S5 edit I've been tempted by this though.. flir  on a cell phone. but no removable battery.. =(
Companies keep forcing people into new phones by making more bloated apps. That shit drives me crazy. So crazy infact that I'm now rocking Lineage os. My one+ 3 has a 2-3 day battery life and I don't get shitty update me things every five seconds. It's it's pretty fast at doing pretty much everything.
"Yes, some people still use Yahoo. Besides, it is still operating."
"Maybe it's difficult for them to publicly admit the issue because it'll cost them big time. They might've planned for the steps to not crucially damage their brand. But still, coming up to the point of admitting the downfall."
"I'd agree totally if the 'Neumann Drive' didn't have the potential to become the next 'Mr Ion' drive, as it can use multiple types of fuel to create thrust. peace..."
We need someone to rummage through his closet to see if he owns any sexist t-shirts so we can discredit him and destroy all of his research.
"""the air molecules""  What you have there is a miss quote mate.  “With our system, we use similar physics but in a different environment. We have our cathode and anode, the negative and the positive part of the plasma discharge, but we don’t have an atmosphere”, no air molecules to rip apart.  I think Paddy Neumann was referring to the fact that the Neumann drive runs on solid fuels, where as a gridded Ion thruster and hall effect thruster both rely on gaseous fuels. Better luck next time mate ;) peace..."
(((Paddy Neumann)))
You say that like its a bad thing
If they admitted it back then it would have made the news. Right after Equifax nobody gives a shit because Equifax was so much worse.
"Lol, each to their own I guess. Need a hug? Go here: Cyberwizardhack@gmail for free hugs. Cheer up love ;) peace..."
"Thanks for the offer Siy but I don't have help. I don't any skillz, I'm just being for my win xp and ms paint to make crazy memes for tumbler. Plus I don't know to use gmails.com? and my mom just said I shouldn't trust people that to help me for no reason.  I did pass that gmails.com code to somebody that seems down and I thought you may be able to dox them instead ;) All the best. Hatson Vantablack, peace..."
"Like the early steam engines, there were a huge amount of engine designs created, but it wasn't until boiler technology caught up did we start to see successful applications.   As you pointed out its all just giving it a go until someone gets it right.  Also, it helps to understand that without some of the earlier advances in steam technology it may have been a lot harder or even inconceivable to build the first functioning boiler. After all, how does one design something effectively, without a good understanding of why it is needed to do the job it is being designed for.  I'd call that a startup product, art or just plain old junk. With that said though, all those things carry the potential to be re-purposed for things that were at the time, outside of the scope/understanding of the person who originally designed and built that thing. All the best, peace..."
Don't hold your breath mate ;) peace...
"They just spewing all sorts of numbers. It’s pretty much every account, so compromised."
I agree the discharge times are great now. i remember when a big chunky laptop that was over 2 hours was standard. But if you could chaage your devise in 5 mins! That would be just as revolutionary as our 10-12 hours output we have now on the low end devises
"If you can't read or use translate, I'm not gonna spell it out for you, because that would be pointless.  Maybe its time you realize, that you just don't have the nous to comprehend its importance and just move on. Otherwise, show me some skill first. peace..."
Haha
