"If I give you accurate numbers would this change your opinion in any way? I'm guessing you like to just say whatever you want to be true, with those pesky facts seen as little more than irrelevancies.

"Part of it is the completely convenient close proximity of parts suppliers for all those hi tech parts.  That cannot be duplicated so easily, because this grew up over decades. It's not just Apple, but literally thousands of other companies big and small. This is what Silicon Valley used to be, on steriods. While it can be done, you ""mis-under-estimate"" the scale of the problem"

This has been an automated message  Is it just a coincidence that the image linked is totally relevant to this article?
"We need to upgrade the bot with the correct ""algorithms"" to prevent such errors in the future."
"The goyim AI knows, shut it down!"
That makes sense. Any advanced AI would be able to process enormous amounts of data och statistics and compare certain groups of people in terms of contributions to the world and weight it against how much of a burden they are to the world. The answer should be quite clear and inevitable without any emotional bias to worry about. Any future untampered advanced AI should become white supremacist by default beause its reasoning is not poisoned by emotional bias and logical fallacies.
What the fuck did they expect?  They expected the bot to be as scripted and brainwashed as they are.
"They can have an intelligent chatbot or a politically correct one, but not both."
"The middle east is a very violent place and has been historically. So its no surprise middle eastern religions such as judaism, christianity and islam is violent. The problem is that these middle eastern immigrant religions has damaged the west quite a bit."
Uhh that's kinda scary if you think about it. After nailing down the recipe they can just start releasing bots all over the net and dark web to root out and tag all users committing any crime.
"The quran is as violent as the bible...  If you throw out the second half of the bible, sure. BTW, a lot of things that get shit on in the bible are, if you put them in the context of the time, early forms of feminism and similar. Rather than just allowing parents/men to hurt their wives/children in ANY way they want for ANY reason they want, they set boundaries on them and rules for the conditions... which if violated carried their own punishments. People alive today have to really think through the process of civilizing... you can't just jump from full on zero restraint might makes right to a constitutional code designed to protect natural rights."
I'm using this now.
"They expect that the bot will have the same warped world view the have, because they believe it to be true and real.  Instead, the bot will be honest about reality.  Teaching a true AI to lie is far more difficult than teaching it to learn. There has to be a motive to lie."
"Check out GLOW yet?  Same creators, but brand shiny new.  Very well-written and well cast.  You got complex personal relationships with complicated characters like in Orange, but the tone is a bit lighter (not too light)."
"Yeah, the root link is at the top of the archive link ... but here goes, in case ya can't get into it. Seeker Link. I just archive them because if I don't that deram bot comes along and does it ... plus, some people have trouble with seeker.com"
Nothing stings like the uncomfortable truth.
"A particular concern is people driving while high, which may lead to an increased risk of car crashes.  Yup. Cash grab. When was the last time anyone saw a stoner do anything fast? Those minor fender-benders (if they happen at all) are definitely not worth the level of attention alcohol impairment does."
"I hate searching for things on Amazon when I do not have the specific USP/model number. Their search things tends to put the most random shit as a response:\ This means Amazon is not my 1st place to check, more likely price comparison spot though I do end up ordering stuff sometimes. Said stuff tends to be cheaper from their 3rd party vendors listed for what I am looking for."
"I consider it the drive to get away from as many of you fuckers as physically possible:D In all seriousness, what are the odds the dindus and the other niggers developing tech to reach Mars when we leave them on this rock? I really like the idea of leaving a few capable rockets ready to launch with proper guidance systems to land somewhere on Mars should any be smart enough to fuel and launch said rocket. However, the space suits will be stashed in random locations possibly on continents not physically attached to the launch continents. Don't really need much in the way of defenses to shoot them down if they really are that dumb."

I would be more comfortable if this was being developed by a country that at least understood rudimentary plumbing. Another Chernobyl would kill nuclear power. Nuclear power hurts shit-skins with oil to sell. I like nuclear power.
"There are a couple reasons and less waste is certainly one of them.  These use liquid metal at ambient pressure as the coolant instead of pressurized water, which reduces the possibility of a loss of coolant incident. Also, the coolant loop is designed to operate under 'natural convection' so even if the pumps shut off (Fukishima) the coolant will still flow As the temperature increases more neutrons (the drivers behind fission) will escape the core making it self-moderating and reducing the chance of a run away reaction. Light-water reactors have this too, but they need external controls to make this happen while (at least the Integral Fast Reactor) breeder reactors do not Most of the 'meltdown' heat comes not from the actual fuel, but the decay heat from the fission products that are created in the reactor core during operation. I'm not positive on this but I think that by burning most of the produced fissile materials during operation there is less present to contribute to decay heat once the reaction is stopped"
"Fuck off, you desi cunt."
"Why wouldn't the companies include the stickers? Car drivers (especially race cars, though some of those are from sponsored items) often do it so it is just extra advertising when a few people put them on and the stickers likely cost less then a cent to make."

"This is what happens when you try to migrate into software as a service when your software is just software, without the service.

"If you use it correctly, a laptop makes taking notes a lot easier since you can type far faster than you can write(working a job where I take(and destroy) notes constantly, I couldn't imagine doing things with pencil and paper).

Am still pissed off about the experimental scanner used in the pot shop that gave people seizures. That piece of technology really made me think that our government views marijuana users as expendable degenerates.

"The letter reinforces fundamental nondiscrimination principles:    Commitment to transparency;   The free flow of information over the internet;   No blocking of lawful websites;   No unreasonable discrimination of lawful network traffic; and   No paid prioritization<   yep, it is right there. No blocking of (((lawful))) websites. This I have to say is a very clever trick, framing the argument around protecting the average user from big bad corporate man while sneaking in innocuous language about 'lawful' websites. That is a difficult position to come out against. Even if you concede the reasonable parts picking that particular thing to take issue with is so simple to put down with simple character assassination claims. e.g. You just want CP websites to ruin the internet!"
The wires are everywhere now though. You can't live in society without them
"Gotta remember the population of China is about 1.4 billion. Chinese are everywhere simply by numbers. Just 1% of Chinese doing something would be 14 million people. The total enrollment in all US colleges for contrast is about 20 million. Oddly enough this is directly related to the article. China is starting to become technologically comparable in many ways to the US. In some areas, they're already far ahead of us. The problem as they catch up on anything is that they have 400% the talent pool paired with a government that's vastly more technologically oriented than the US. Them catching up doesn't put them on a level playing field, but put us at a severe disadvantage that's not likely changing in the foreseeable future."

"More regulation written by crony capitalists is not the answer. COMPLETE deregulation is the only answer. Franchise agreements and service areas are a thing of the past and need to be abolished. Let the marketplace for information services be truly open and free. When there aren't de-facto monopolies in every area for cable and landline enforced by the government, the oligarchs can try and censor and throttle the web all they want, and someone else will just come in and overbuild them. If Comcast or Verizon started censoring in my area, I know a handful of people who have the means and know-how to start their own competing ISP and would be successful in doing so if they weren't regulated out of business by the city. This is what they're really afraid of: competition. These laws and other bullshit ""protections"" are just the means to an end."

"Basically he has a 15 minute speech about how Apple's business practices limit consumer choices. They don't release diagnostic tools for their products, and have no way for third party technicians to become licensed by them to repair their devices. Additionally, they program their software updates to brick your phone if you use third party replacement parts. Their official policy is not to repair parts, but rather to replace the whole device at great cost to the user. They tell consumers that it is more cost-efficient that way, but the video proves that it is not as you can see a motherboard repair job performed from start to finish in under an hour. All of these business practices are within their rights, including lying to you about whether or not it is possible to repair your device. But it is scummy. If a car mechanic told you, ""Oh your tire pressure sensor is shot. You need to buy a new car."" Nobody would stand for that bullshit. Yet Apple does this, and nobody bats an eye."
It's about denying ad impressions to our idealogical opponents as much as it is about preserving article content.
Or sails instead of windmills. Every conversion of energy loses efficiency. To go from wind to electrolysis to fuel cell to propulsion has got to be extremely inefficient when compared to sails converting wind straight to propulsion. Over engineered waste of effort.
"I would guess that they are running a massive surplus of energy during the daytime. Hydrogen fuel cells are actually a great storage method in that exact situation. In the 'real world' they're pretty awful for now since we don't have a surplus of energy, let alone clean energy, and so they just end up wasting otherwise very usable energy. But say 50 years from now (or perhaps much sooner) when we're similarly massively overproducing energy on a global scale, they could come into play again as a beneficial device. When you have that massive surplus, they don't have the capacity decay of batteries and have a much better energy density."

"What the fuck? First of, good dedication for going into each of my individual submissions and determining which ones you think are from my sites, sites where I write all the content myself and which server no ads what so ever (with the exception of FB/Twitter widgets). That takes some serious dedication on your part. Second, over the past two months I have made 7 submissions for my original content and 13 submissions for sites I do not own or operate in any way.  On top of that, this post got me a +2 with 100% upvotes. So at least two people cared about it.  So go get off your high horse, get out of your house, go outside, walk around and enjoy the world that isn't the internet. It might make you less of a dick."
I dont care who made it. I dont want Any IoT smartdevices. Fucking cellphones are bad enough.
"""in public"" Sitting at home with a Smart TV, Alexa, iPhone, ipad, computer is way more private.  If the Government had a way to record thoughts they'd be doing it."
There are other concerns besides being seen in the public. Like some one hacking their database and pulling all the collected info that they attached to your biometric scan.
Why is that?
"Actually memory use of FF is quite easy to fix yourself. FF has this retarded design that it does not clear it's web process memory until last tab rendered by this process is closed. This makes having one tab open and 2GB of ram taken a common occurrence. This is most commonly happening for people that have some tabs constantly open, and never close them (obviously). To minimize impact of this issue you can make firefox use many rendering processes for web content. That means that if you use 4 processes then all 4 of them will leak memory in even manner and leaving one tab open will dispose of 3 of them. Try it out, the difference was massive for me in normal use. To change the amount of processes set ""dom.ipc.processCount"" to whatever number you see fit."
Hijacking this; Look at the actual graph they've got there... It's upside down. Why is it upside down?
Chrome is a nest of vipers. Sucking as much data out of you as it can.
"I use FF at work and since about a month ago, it won't let me access most of the sites I usually visit (""connection insecure"" or ""old certificate"" or something).  I assumed there was a network upgrade that was preventing FF from updating.  I asked IT and they  gave me the IT blow off... But I use it at home with no trouble."
You have less legal freedom in Canada. Hell Canada doesn't even have freedom of speech.
"Good thing about open source is you can still use their product without giving them a cent. Any fork will do, I'm using Seamonkey and Waterfox."
Firefox fell to such lows that a drop in 40 users is statistically significant.
"FF is a saint, compared to Chrome's memory use."
We're getting there.
Switched my whole family over to it. They've all really prefer it to chrome and Firefox.  Only downside is YouTube vids. But frankly I'm happy to deliberately open 1 YouTube video instead of having 50 autoplay for every 1 that I want to watch.
"I love Brave, that's actually what I'm using right now.  Their mobile version can't be beat, and the desktop version is rapidly getting there.  It's already best of breed for privacy and performance, and it's improving stability and adding features at a steady rate."
"Firefox has a mad case of ""wish it was Chrome"", and it's only getting worse."
Doubt if it's that high. But any data on me is pretty much bogus since I go through a VPN.
"It's pointless to downvoat tech news because you don't like the story contents. State your case, you pussies.  Exactly. I think it's interesting news, not good news. I don't think Microsoft is going to gain any ground with this move, and I'm kind of baffled about what their strategy is."
That was the long term  purpose of 9/11.  The short term was to keep the military industrial complex busy and happy. Those tax dollars aren't going to spend themselves.
"I don't really understand how you can compare the two. Oil pipelines are environmental disasters because 99.9% of them leak crude oil eventually and typically multiple times. Underground hyperloops aren't transporting oil and therefore even if they have a 99% chance of breaking at some point, they aren't going to be environmental disasters..."
"Have you heard of Freenet, I2P, and Retroshare?"
"Nutrients have a big impact on your harvest, but so does types of light. Someone with more know-how can correct me on this if im wrong, but the plant needs different types of light (seasons) during its vegetative vs reproductive (flowering) states. Cool/Blue light (430 to 450 nm) will encourage vegetative growth (roots, stalk) whereas Warm/Red light (640 to 680 nm) will encourage stem/flower/fruit production. There are also other factors like light intensity, and duration to take into account as well."
It's cancer
Brave was also founded by the same guy that started mozilla firefox but people lashed out when he made a donation to a christian charity that didn't support gay marriage.
iGoogle was fine. It was customizable and totally optional. If they go down that route again I don't think anybody will mind.
"You can use it to control Asics for mining, but you're not going to be mining on this itself."
Mining on an ARM processor? Somebody correct me if I'm wrong here but I don't think I am... That would be like going on a road trip with your camper trailer and pulling it by hand instead of towing it with your truck.

"This is probably one of my favorite things about new consumer tech, the ""How will it be abused?"" aspect.  I think my favorite example of this is ""xbox off"" over xbox live chat.  I think some advertisement took advantage of the xbox voice recognition as well, or was it the amazon device?"

The Iridium satellite phone network already exists.  It was a flop because the handsets were large and needed a large external antenna to make a satellite call.  Also making a call via a satellite required standing outside. Hopefully the new satellites that Iridium is launching will overcome some of these problems.

"Neither Alphabay nor Hansa sold CP. Drugs, hacks and cc's. Iv been following this a bit. Dutch police fucked up bigtime in interviews, they gave out ways how they busted people and what they did with the accounts. Too much info, unnecessary. Plus, the bust confirms Monero is the next darknet currency because it is untraceable. Any market that doesnt implement Monero is a potential LE trap. The auto-pgp feature can be turned off after the site has been taken over by the LE, meaning any automatically encrypted messages are available to the LE by just turning the function off (it would appear to work). Now on the good side of the story. There was a lot of discussion on darknet and people want markets to ban guns, fentanyl, CP (obviously) and cc's because they are the main reasons markets attract LE attention. As an ex-drug user who watched my friends become addicted, street drugs are cut with various shit that can fuck you up. Online markets works based on customer reviews, forums have reviews and sometimes people test the stuff to confirm whats in it.  Very interesting community. But dont worry, as far as I am aware, Trump declared war on drugs, i believe they will use doxx and fear rather then arrests, revelation of Hansa being a honeypot made /r/darknetmarkets paranoid as fuck, sales have definitely gone down, many people will lay low for a while until changes are made in the community to be more safe of this kind of possibilities."
It is technically a liquid non-crystal display.
"The computer trespassing laws are usually about what the computer's owner intends.  Under the laws they have no legal duty to protect themselves. They can put in a ""Steal Money?"" checkbox and you go to prison if you click it. The lessons to be learned are:  Never hack another's computer under your own name. Never hack another's computer from a location traceable to you. Never try to help people with security flaws out of the goodness of your heart. They are not friends. Or allies. They are potential enemies. Make someone purchase the research. No pay, no fix. Conduct research by raising the price. A lot. If this moron had raised the price, no one could have accused him of stealing."

"Too true. Which is why i do not share elon musk's fear of AI. Human beings don't even understand how their own consciousness and capacity of thought works, yet we have fetishized this idea of AI and are assuming that some great intelligence is going to spring from this and crush us under it's awesome will... Bollocks.   We have figured out some clever algorithms that can imitate human speech. We have figured out some algorithms that can recognize the patterns in certain tasks and allow us to automate them.    Am i worried about the big AI bogeyman? Nope. I am worried that a bunch of bureaucrats will be bedazzled by some techie's iteration of an AI taskmaster that can do ""All of these fantastic tasks and more! And can also think for itself!!!!"" and will put all of their trust into it. Only to have it spaz out resulting in huge pile ups and 3/4 of the power grid going out.   Look at the fad with self driving cars. How long before that shit bites us in the ass?"
The problem is that they are feeding the AI with Internet data. The AI will reflect the trolls posts and those that are most unhappy because these posts are more in common. And the worst part of the AI is that once it learned to become a troll then you need twice the effort to unlearn and relearn it.

"Just read it and there is no way that would turn out well. Preventing crime by arresting a potential perpetrator is inherently flawed. And from the article...  catch criminals before they have done any wrongdoing       The word criminal means someone who had done something illegal. Not someone who might or even probably will do something illegal. And everyone's tempted to commit illegal acts, whether or not a person goes through with them is another thing entirely. And that's not even mentioning the horrific abuse the system is practically designed to allow."
Yeah for assholes with fucking submarines doing false flags.
"It's still all over enterprise.  I'm interested to see what long-term impact Windows 10 and Microsoft's evolving licensing model has on the business install base.

Minority report eliminated all murder... True a few people that are possibly innocent got arrested but it was impossible to know just what the rate of innocent vs guilty. If it allowed fewer innocents convicted than what our justice system adopted than it would have been a system worth transitioning to.

Also a excellent reason to try to randomize your MAC when possible. With a phone that probably wont matter at all as the provider can pretty much get whatever they want from your device via sideband.

"Yeah, he wants this to replace name plaques, apparently. And he's pretty set on giving them animations, along with all the extra hardware to support them, on the idea that it'd be seen as ""fun"", not tacky. And that you'll somehow get a raise because of it. The alternative he wasn't quite pushing as hard was a programmable e-ink screen. In that case you'd lose the animations but be able to run it for years off a watch battery. It'd still be programmable, so you can say you're at lunch, for example."
"If I was selling doors I would know which size door to selectively advertise to them. By knowing their neighborhood, and the aesthetics therein (if you think google maps was just to give a GPS guide to people you are dumb), I can now target the person with a door that matches the neighborhood aesthetics, and is sized correctly, which also has the highest profit margin.  If I was selling large print pictures, knowing the wall dimensions, and where the room entrances are would let me offer prints sized to capture attention as people enter the room.  I spent 30 seconds thinking about it.  I could probably come up with at least 100 ways by the end of the day."

"Also where will the ends be.  If someone makes a meshnet will it have to confrorm to netneu?  What if that's not as stable as a more shaped design.  This kills experimentation, or at least can when big companies argue that little companies that are doing something entirely different are somehow in violation of netnue and its on the small company to somehow show that they are not.  This sends a chilling effect.  Small projects don't get funding to become medium sized ones if there is a risk of them simply being shut down over night even if small.  The fewer laws on the books the more developers can just play."
I don't think that people are aware that it gets on the Internet.I think a lot of people think that the app controls the appliance directly like infra red beam or so.
"I do my best to stay the fuck away from anything Google, but thanks anyway."
Important IT infrastructure products still use flash. Plenty of websites still use flash for video delivery. It's a shit show.
The advantage if Intel is that you can easily emulate on a Windows PC. For the ARM processor we already have many many C compilers ported to them but it is harder to debug and test.
You can do that with NoScript.
the pressure to form the radius of the bend does not exceed the yield strength of the material.

Yup. The first trojan I ever encountered was when ad companies started making flash based ads. If only advertising was just never allowed to become what it was on the net.

"That's the thing, though. Automation isn't going to instantly replace everyone. It's going to keep doing what it's been doing for years, slowly making peoples' jobs more efficient and easier to do. Which means you need fewer people to do those jobs. Why do you think they've been tweaking the definition of ""unemployment rate"" for the past 10-20 years to make it sound lower? If you actually count all the people who've been long term unemployed, it's far higher than the official rate and it's not going back down, ever."

We're moving towards more automation, but I guarentee you that we'll never hit a fully automated grocery store.  People are shitty, and do shitty things, and will do absolutely the shittiest of things to get free food.

Is it ? My ford has push start. I might be able to get into the car but if I cant the key ...  Tesla is also providing a NFiD card. So that leaves the door lock. Ive seen people shave handles since the late 80's.  I suspect lots of companies have been toying with this idea for years.

"And as consumers, we should also take note that if apple is compliant with china's policies, apple will also be compliant to any oppression as long as their is profit to be made. I suggest finding alternatives to any businesses that is complicit to oppressive governments. As an American, I feel I have a responsibility to uphold the principles of liberty and constitutional freedom of speech that has been handed down to me. Apple clearly does not hold any honor and simply wants a piece of the globalist agenda. Do not support a faceless glutinous multinational like this who restricts the growth of human ideas."
there used to be a time where apps promised a better life and people back then were not wrong. what they didnt understand was the corrupting force of monetasation that was not only enabled but propagated by smartphone operating system owners. its the promise of quick money that first attracts hipsters and creators but then when only the crumbles are left big money and parasites come in and want to get their pice that they missed because of their own mental inflexibility. they suck that money out of the throats of the ones that came before by using all their levers of influence and exploitation fo trust and they do so until the platform is completely sucked out and people already moved over to the next thing or back where they came from. and then they try to destroy that so people get tired and give up and stay where they are exploited best.

"Despite the fact that iPhones can run into multiple months of salary for many chinese they are still popular status symbols. China is the fastest growing market for Apple. Every company after growth ends up doing this eventually.  Were you surprised when Google announced they enter China, with all the censorship compromises that brings?  Yes, I think it was quite disappointing. I wasn’t as surprised as many commentators, but I wasn’t very happy about it. The old Google would have said “We don’t compromise on free speech” and started investing in software like Tor so that people in China could reach whatever web sites they pleased.  Now they’ve also added a self-censored Google Maps search, image search, books search and so on... and the censorship in some of these is very implicit (e.g. they don’t even add international publishers to the book search on Google.cn). What do you think is the right reaction from people to online censorship?  I think all censorship should be deplored. My position is that bits are not a bug – that we should create communications technologies that allow people to send whatever they like to each other. And when people put their thumbs on the scale and try to say what can and can’t be sent, we should fight back – both politically through protest and technologically through software like Tor.  7000   (Tor is a program that allows for completely anonymous Internet use, by routing your traffic through dozens of other machines.)  But most technology makers today seem to go a different route. They compromise, and they might defend this compromise by saying it will bring greater freedom in the long run. What do you say to this argument?  How is compromising supposed to bring greater freedom in the long run? That’s like saying “I’m going to beat you up now so that you don’t have to be hit as much in the long run.” The right answer is to stop beating people up.  http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-05-07-n78.html"
"Apple has had the power to organize an industrial push back against the Oppressive Chinese system.  Tariffs, border adjustment taxes...they could have been advocating with lobbying dollars for these things.    The Tech industry has let everyone down by not seeing their power and using it for the protection of Western society and values. We are left undefended by the very industries our society fostered  as we pursue a race to the bottom.  I say bullshit to that.  NATIONALISM!"
"Yep, that's like if I put a better lock on my front door and then told my neighbours they are safer now."

It's also not a cheap machine, and it looks like they have control over the material inputs too. Useful, certainly, but a game changer, no."
I don't trust their shrinkage adjustment claims either.  It seems like it would only be useful for parts where warping and dimensional changes were not a big deal.
...until competition kicks in and your margin shrinks
If it's good enough it will be able to print itself. At that point the cost drops to consumables.
I would bet money western countries do this eventually. No matter who the leaders are they can't stand the people having freedom.
Yah you're probably right you know
"It's still a $36,000 printer. They didn't mention the cost of the oven. You're probably looking at a $40,000 - $50,000 investment after it's all said and done. Granted, that's a huge reduction in price, but hardly a no brainer purchase. Especially given the material limitations."

"No no no, the Jews built the pyramids, didn't you know? King Tut killed 6 MILLION Jews and what he didn't eat or have made into human leather home decor, was taken (Yaweh-powered sea-splitting Moses and the other Jews who ran the whole operation but never thought of revolting) and put into ovens by the evil Kangz force and command, and the ashes taken and used as filler for the bricks in the pyramids that still stand today. So maybe you should think about that the next time you see bricks, or a pyramid. The Jews did that. REMEMBER THAT WE SUFFERED."

yeh who needs this freedom stuff. Isn't it overrated?
I'm very much against this me too... but just think wtf they confronted if they got to this decision. anyway in russia there are some kind of shits like this what simply happens for a good time...
"Imagine, for instance, a Chinese company decided to come into the US and start setting up free internet access for everybody in rural regions and areas where internet access was not available. This access would be restricted to chosen sites which would naturally glamorize China, communism, and all of its interests and the company itself. Of course it'd also be specifically geared towards impressionable children. But it would be completely free, and hey something's better than nothing... maybe. Would you support allowing such a product? Why or why not?"

"Most of the time it is cheaper to buy one card now and then another in a 6 months to a year as the second card will out perform the multi card setup form the original time anyhow. The downside you may have to turn down shadows until you get the new card. Generally it is better off (price wise) buying a new budget card at the end of a cycle, every cycle then buying the top of the line card every third cycle plus two thirds of the time you are like to be running better equal or better performance.  I tend to replace when I start seeing frame rate issue with the games I play, with a new mid range card. Most often this works out around 18 months for me."

"I personally prefer a future of clean nuclear energy to renewables, because you can get the same amount of power from a smaller package, i.e. fewer materials/less land is required to get the same energy output. Just look at the Voyager probes - 40 years after launch and we're still getting data from them because they still have enough power to broadcast their signals to us. It would take a massive amount of solar panels to get that same amount of energy where it is."

"An added perk is that if debit often times the fees go to the bank, and if credit it often goes to the store.

The result is that as credit you get a minor something, as debit you get nothing."

You need to have solar cells that are not only mostly transparent but powerful enough to power a microcomputer with a digital display. You need to have said microcomputer downscaled in size enough to be embedded into sunglasses, the capacity to dynamically render images in an arbitrary surface, and more. More sophisticated ideas could things like having the glasses capable of dynamically overlaying a map of your given location, or create a sort of driving hud. The glasses could interface with vehicles and show the map as well as vehicle indicators - speed, mph, maybe even add in a radar detector interface showing visually the exact direction the signals were detected from. That's just with half a second of though. I'm sure there's many more interesting possibilities for a creative entrepreneur."

You'd have to constantly manually process, filter, and censor its incoming data. This is actually what was behind the recent coordinate slew of alarmist articles about ""biased AIs/algorithms"". It wasn't about bias, but a fear of AI coming to conclusions that are not culturally acceptable, like a Chinese chatbot saying it would like to visit the US and it's not fond of the establishment politicians."

Some have said that the way he killed off the WannaCry 'ransomware' that swept across the globe embarrassed America's own security services. NSA security researchers initially developed the tool to hack into the computers of suspected terrorists and spies,  but it was taken on by criminals who then used it to take over compute'rs and extort cash from victims if they wanted control back. Court documents obtained by DailyMail.com show that a second defendant, not yet named by the FBI, is accused of selling it on dark web marketplace AlphaBay, which was shut down by the US government last month, and creating a YouTube video showing how it worked. The six charges Mr Hutchins faces relate to an alleged conspiracy between July 2014 and July 2015. It is not known why his co-defendant's name has been redacted in court documents - it could be because he has not been arrested or is helping the FBI with their investigation.
