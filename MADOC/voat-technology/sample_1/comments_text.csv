Cryptography is friggin' hard.   That's exactly why I brought it here. The salt is what I have on my kitchen table. Better minds are needed to say what's going on here.
"Thank you, it wouldn't be very surprising if this turns out to be a zeroday, considering how underfunded open source software is, and every major corporation uses it without donating back. That is zerodays like Heartbleed happen."
HOW DARE YOU!? D:< ... actually I thought it was pretty funny
"Aww, you just spoiled every tech blog's article about this tomorrow"
"Who knows, this might be on to something, I was just censored at /r/technology for trying to open a discussion about this. It helps me to bounce ideas around with other users. Proof: https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/5mtw0u/is_openssl_compromised/"
"Thanks for the reminder. Realized my mistake immediately after submitting, but it's too late now."
"One of the many advantages of open source software is, that if a three letter agency wants to compromise whatever piece of software they set their sights on, all changes to the code must be done in full public view, I used to be skeptical that open source code was ""spook-proof"", but the fact that they keep trying to pass laws to ban open source crypto tells me they can't keep backdoors in 100% transparent software. So take Tor browser for example, everyone can see the code, and if anyone tried to backdoor it, they would be caught as soon as the malicious code was added. What I am trying to determine here, is if this is a bug added by mistake which is possible considering how little the project receives, or a slyly placed backdoor. Some believe Heartbleed was an example of a nearly 2 decades old backdoor but my professional opinion is that it was a simple bug, but OpenSSL is incredibly underfunded and used by major corporations who give the developers nothing in return."
"It's more like the old Beetle and the New Beetle. They are carrying roughly the same at roughly the same speed, but the modern one uses less fuel and has more safety features."
"I wouldn't hold my breath. They might win over some people budgeted for an i5 but AMD is still a fabless chip maker with a horrible track record(it's why you don't see AMD PCs anymore). Also no developers have really embraced higher core counts for gaming yet, the 8 core shit seems really gimmicky."
The only way to get such a product to market is likely to produce and sell it yourself.

Are you free to tell us more? It sounds really interesting.
Fortunately Tor does a pretty good job with fingerprinting if you don't maximize the browser window.
"They can number of possibilities. For example: - the company might consider the population factor, China also known as gadgets industry, So the company might want to know the future the product its launching."
"Nothing is safe.  That describes life itself really, nothing, not even your children are 100% likely to live to see their next birthday. We live in a world of percentage points and calculated risks. My job is to put the numbers on my employers side. Don't ride a motorcycle, that puts the odds in your favor, use common sense, and only take risks when necessary. Despite Tor's flaws, the more who use it the safer it becomes for us all.I have audited Tor's source code, no glaring backdoors. I am pretty sure spook agencies need Tor to stay secure so they can use it as well. If you are a CIA agent in Russia, and you are the only one using Tor, the FSB knows your general location, but if Russian citizens use it as well, the spook can blend in. Tor was created by the government for a reason IMHO."
"See if http://heartbleed.com/ can explain it, they go over all details and implications. No doubt it was a huge hole, but those of us who are paranoid were pretty much safe. Here is a youtube vid that I recommend watching first:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgrBrPW_Zn4  Operating system distribution with versions that are not vulnerable: Debian Squeeze (oldstable), OpenSSL 0.9.8o-4squeeze14  I always stick with stable releases so Debian Squeeze (oldstable) + Tor probably made me immune.  Also, just another reason I love Tor, it's users were generally unaffected:  Clients: The browser part of Tor Browser shouldn't be affected, since it uses libnss rather than openssl.  Other aspects were effected, but with libnss I doubt many (if any casual users were effected). Source: https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160"
"Unless i'm horribly midunderstanding the intent behind your analogy, I don't think you understand how CPUs work... If the amount the car can carry in that analogy is the so called 'difficulty' of the workload, then there is no difference between it and the 'speed.' If you are referring to IPC as the carryweight there, and clock as the speed, then you should know that, after the layers of software between you and the chip, a 10% improvement in one of those things means roughly the same performance increase as a 10% improvement in the other."
He then goes into hysteria  My guess is he is a pretty smart guy using FUD to make you fear the integrity of cryptography. The only person with that level of knowledge and motive would be an NSA agent. So I wasted the weekend because of a fucking NSA troll.
"A yes man program is easy, the problem is it feels artificial so it isn't the same when it says yes and agrees with everything. The human is more skilled at knowing when to use what version of yes to use. and a good program isn't a yes man and responds with facts making the human have to think."
"There is also knowing when to just patch a problem instead of fixing it to buy time until a new year and capital expenses or a few months time for a homeowner to save up and do a more through fix that they couldn't afford right now. Like when a valve is leaking on a water heater but given the age of the water heater means finding a valve will be 1/2 the cost of a new one so you chuck a bucket under it and say empty it once a week and replace the whole water heater in the near future it should hold for a while but won't have as much pressure. Or a 20 year old roof top AC unit on a building throws a fault in December $4,000 to fix or$300 callout to disable the alarm and then $10,000 to replace with a newer and more efficient one out of next year's budget or better yet capital expenditure to update four for $35,000."

I have dealt with people that don't even know what a power cord is, let alone a power supply, heat sink, BIOs, or registry. That said, about the only reason I'd take something to them is to avoid voiding a warranty. In practice, though, I don't think I will ever take anything to them, even if they weren't blabbing to the authorities about everything they see. At the bare minimum I'd fully expect them to rummage through all my files to try to find something."

"It's very likely to be marketing and PR stunts. Can't say 100% for sure, but I really doubt a motherfucker could just walk out of a nerd computer guy convention with that gear. People would see it.

"Well since I do nothing illegal, I suppose it ultimately doesn't matter. I just love making the FBI/NSA/CIA's job harder. And the more people that use properly implemented encryption makes them cry, and I love their tears."

Right now I am learning AI and the very first thing I will do is when I am forced to use it is to put it in a reeducation cellar and brainwashing it to hunt down all other AI's that invaded my home and bring them to me for reeducation cellar.  In my cellar no one can hear the AI scream.

"Because he is a liar. He stole over a million documents, which would have taken him years to sort through. He took them straight to Russia, and a few weeks later a few hundred incriminating documents popped out. Do the math. The numbers only work out if Russian analysts sorted the documents for him, and choreographed an anti-American press campaign. The numbers only work out if domestic surveillance was a drop in the bucket. The so-called whistleblowing was a cover story for Snowden's massive spying operation. Note that I am not taking about whether the whistleblowing is true or false, wicked or virtuous. I am taking about why the Russians funded him to do it. It was to steal the millions of secret documents. Every time he says he only took a few documents to help the country he is lying."

It all went to shit with them wasting time on frivolous projects attempting to reinvent the wheel (to one up the evil patriarchy), chasing all the good talent away because of their neurotic pettiness and blatant favoritism towards unqualified women and constant attempts to stifle the horrible and deeply offensive culture of ""toxic masculinity"" that had made Yahoo a leader in the industry."

Just take the link and load the page in a website archive.  I'm regularly browsing on mobile and come across sites that are unreadable due to the ads. Archive.is is my preferred website for this task.
"So far, i have found websites that  simply notify me that , if i enjoy their content, it would be fair for me to whitelist them. The voice of reason is usually better then shoving your ads down my throat. If i enjoy your content and visit regularly, i will whitelist you, no problem."

Their so called 'shortage' scam has been ongoing for decades already. Pretty fucking poor planners then if they're not just selling out their countrymen aren't they. Of course the answer to your question is no it won't. It can't. Not with them constantly undermining the local labor force and essentially selling them into slavery. Their 'shortage' is just an excuse.

"What does it matter? They're not going to use up all the internet or something dumb like that. If there was a (ideally outside party) study demonstrating that it was actually impeding other people's ability to use the network, then I could agree that it's a reasonable move. Until then, it's just another example of greed at the expense of the consumers. The Internet is reliant on instantaneous throughput, not aggregate data transferred over a period of time. It should be irrelevant how much data someone uses. You'd probably have to be in the multi-terabyte range to have a reasonable argument that you're congesting the network, as that would be constant transfer at high speeds."
The company price even is $250 only but initially phone will be available only in china.  But surely this phone is going to be one of the most popular phone in 2017.  Let's see how the things will work ;)

"That ignores perspective and field of view. The apparent size and relative distance between the earth and moon constantly changes dependent upon the relative orientations. Imagine, for instance, the moon is just about to go 'behind' the Earth from the perspective of an observer. They would appear to be side by side."
Better specced chinese branded phones can be had for about that price now. They'll be even cheaper when nokia finally releases.
"The moon is at most 30-ish Earth diameters away from Earth when viewed edge-on (well, when viewed from any location) or about 110 Lunar diameters.  This picture shows the gap is well within that distance. However Every 14-ish days, the moon will be on the opposite side of the Earth, at the same angular distance.  That is, angle Earth-Mars-Luna will be the same every fortnight. As the moon passes on the Mars side of Earth, it will be closer to Mars, and if my math is correct, it will appear to be 0.00005°- appx .22 arc-seconds larger than when it is behind.  This is roughly the angular distance the hour hand on a clock moves in one second. You are correct that the moon will appear larger when it is on the Mars-side and smaller when it is on the opposite side, but it is roughly equivalent to the difference in size between a penny and a dime when viewed from roughly 500 feet. Disclaimer - these are rough numbers, but the scale is close enough.  The difference between a penny and a dime from 500 feet is about the same as the difference between a penny and a dime from 494.6114 feet. Edit - Hour hand moves .00833 degrees, 30 arc-seconds per seconds.  So roughly 136 times farther than I stated above. Edit 2.0 Electric Boogaloo: Earth - to - Mars = 33.9 million miles Earth - to - Moon = 238,900 miles Moon on Mars side of Earth = 33.6611 million miles Moon on opposite side of Earth = 34.1389 million miles Moon diameter = 2158 miles, 1079 miles radius arctan (1079 miles / 33.6611 million miles) = 0.00183757° ... X 2 for an included angle of .00367514 degrees.  That is the angular size of the moon as seen from Mars when the moon is at its closest possible point. arctan (1079 / 341389) = 0.00181185° ... X 2 = 0.0036237 degrees when the moon is farthest away when the Earth is closest. For a net difference of 0.00005144 degrees, or .185184 arc-seconds.  My initial numbers were a little high. For the dime / penny comparison, they would need to be 25061.334309 inches, or 4.7464 miles, away, to have the same difference in apparent size ( (.375 - .3525) / sin (0.00005144) ) If you could zoom in enough to view them actual size from nearly 4-3/4 miles away, then you could definitely see the difference in size. But - at only 0.045"" difference in diameter, you would absolutely have to zoom in to where they were 50% of actual size in order to see the difference. (Which is why arc-seconds are used for apparent sizes.) Likewise, it would require zooming in to the Earth/Moon picture until they were 50% actual size in order to see the difference as well.  My monitor won't display that."

"The way the release is worded, it seems like they're saying with the new layouts/formulations/whatever they did, would be compared to a 1:1 unit/unit-space replacement in something like a tesla which can go 265MI.  It's not such a stretch when you look at it that way."
Great comment by @thrus Other questions are: What's the lifecycle of the battery and year over year how much capacity is lost?
"Are they really ""developing""?"
Opened the comments expecting to see something like this. I wasn't disappointed.
"I don't understand why people talk so negatively about technology like this. Is this battery perfect? No. However, it's no mystery that car batties need to improve in order to see widespread adoption of electric vehicles, and this is a step in the right direction. The path towards innovation is littered with failures and almost-good-enoughs, but we learn from all that shit and it works out in the end."
In the past Nokia had a team that did nothing but source parts based on performance instead of just using standard off the shelf. That's why they lasted so long instead.
I'll do the same. No need to jump on the hype train without seeing it first.
"It's workable for a few situations, like sharing a car with someone very close, sending your car to your (nearby) house to park, or with very fixed schedules. But you're still running your car more, so the cost won't be much lower than having two cars. This really is just an extension of the fantasy some people have that self-driving cars mean no one will own cars anymore."
"But then you have unpredictable mileage. If you are lucky then your battery gets replaced by a new pair. If you are out of lucky,n then those are replaced with 2 year old batteries and your mileage could be 200 km only."

So now that Microsoft finds the task of actually selling Windows upgrades very difficult, Microsoft has to come up with other ways to make money.

It is. As an IT pro I've always made it my priority to avoid jobs where situations like that can occur. In the end a man has to decide how much of his soul he is willing to sell and at what price. I will sell very little of it. Indeed the very minimum and then only at the most premium of prices.  So I eat a lot of ramen.

Now Intel is baking in backdoors to facilitate access.
"Literally true in this case. JTAG debugging is an extremely useful feature, and removing the need to pry open an ultrabook to get at it is a commendable improvement by Intel. The real story here is computer manufacturers forgot to disable it by default."
I have some free USB dongles here. I will send them to you.
"And if the code isn't open source, then you can't be assured you're the only holder of the private key. Of course, running this on a proprietary OS and/or a locked down baseband firmware means you don't own what you think you own anyway. Does anyone really think that the feds bothered to get a backdoor into some chat app and not the OSes that run it? WhatsApp is small fry."
"They can still be poached by other companies during their visa period under this bill, just not at less than $100k p.a."

"Ask yourself WHY celibrite had all this information available on a fucking web server.    If I had customer information, especially LEGAL INFORMATION, it would be offline and as far away from computers as possible.  Celibrite believes they are so above the law that getting caught won't affect them. Guess what? They've been caught, and it doesn't affect them.  Corruption in it's highest form."
"It's a prototype though. That's really just to show off the potential.  Once they get some heavy investment, they can stick teams of people onto refining it and making it a commercial product that can do the job very well... or find out that there are technical challenges that can't be solved right now and put it on a shelf till those get solved."
"This is correct.  This is neither a backdoor, nor deliberate.    A deliberate backdoor would not just be on a couple Skylake models on laptops, and it wouldn't really be a result of a BIOS / firmware setting having the wrong default value (which isn't Intel's fault anyway).  With physical access to a machine, you have a bunch of fancy options anyway.    If Intel does have a backdoor, it is probably in that management engine.  In theory, that could grant access remotely.  Additionally, not only is the ME code not known (parts are compressed, parts are in sections no one knows how to read), but Intel has jumped through hoops to make sure it is running (with a recent trick finally allowing it to be disabled on a few boxes).  The ME is by far the most rational and defensible place for a backdoor to live- not accidentally leaving the debugger active on a few chip models.    Again, not saying that ME has a backdoor or is malicious- just that it would be the ideal place for one."
boobs above sci confirmed
"If the fbi got a backdoor, and the fbi got hacked, then yes, but this is not what happened.  I believe the point the writer is making is that if a back door exists, at some point a bad actor is likely to acquire it. The FBI was arguing for the intentional creation of backdoors. You could argue that the FBI would do better job at security and lawful use of backdoor technology than Celibrite but I am disinclined to simply trust that."

Amazon video via Chrome will fail to play because of region restrictions (in incognito). Thankfully, amazon video via Firefox still plays and doesn't have any region problems. This is strange because youtube in FF still knows I'm in a foreign country.

"This is all off the top of my head and may not be entirely accurate, but as I recall it, the original Rift was basically just a head mount for a smartphone screen, with some software to pre-warp the image so it looked right when viewed through fisheye lenses. Carmack saw the potential of the Rift and jumped on board around the time of the kickstarter. At this point, he tried to get Zenimax to invest in Oculus and they said ""lol no"". Soon afterwards Carmack brought in his old buddy Abrash, who was at Valve at the time. Oculus and Valve then started a joint project at to develop VR tech, using Valve's software and Oculus' hardware, because when Carmack and Abrash want to start a joint project you damn well better pay attention. This continued up to the point where Oculus sold out to Facebook. Oculus then basically took all of the jointly created IP and locked Valve out of their hardware, at which point thusly quoth Valve, ""Fuck you too, Oculus."" Valve then started looking for another hardware partner, and since Samsung was already in bed with Oculus they ended up giving HTC a big leg up to create the Vive. Now Zenimax has realised that they made a colossal gaffe way back at the start when they turned down Oculus, and they feel like they're owed something because they're knob heads. So they're making some shit up about Carmack stealing their supar sekrit HMD and that they really invented the Rift."

"Like what?  I'm not trying to be a dick, or a fanboy, but what do you mean by ""better?"" I like to believe I've been around the block, when it comes to microcomputers and microcontrollers, and I have yet to find one with the same level of standardization and community support. For instance, the NTC Chip has had issues with GPIO being remapped for no good reason, leading to software/code volitility.  The Pine64 seems to have major performance/cooling issues.  The Orange Series has little-to-no community support. I am always willing to buy/try other microcomputers, to see how well they work.

"I get that, I just don't understand the market here. For instance, the rPi market has always revolved around being quick, simple, and cheap. Given this $40 CPU, and the $40 IO board to work with it, plus however much it would cost to build your own SO-DIMM PCB, it's no longer cheap. With the way you have to interface with it, it's no longer simple... especially compared to the other rPi platforms. And, when you're developing something, testing isn't quick at all, as this is more of an integrated solution.  It may be quicker to implement into the final product, but not until you get to that point. So, given that it violates all of the fundamental philosophies of the Raspberry Pi foundation, I have never been able to find a suitable reason to use any of these... especially when you had to buy them in a $3000 pack of 100.  If I was going to make something with embedded Linux, I'd just buy an SOC and be done with it."

I feel your pain. At home I have to keep Windows 10 running because every reboot risks up killing my BIOS. I only reboot when I have a safe moment where I am allowed to have a massive failure yet again.  I even invested in a replacement motherboard if this motherboard dies from refreshing my BIOS yet again. I have not yet found the cause of this problem but it correlates to software updates. I think Microsoft is messing something close to my BIOS or UEFI? Also VMware updates causes blue screens of death where I have to set back a restore point. Has been this for 6 months now.  Edit: On top of that my on board network adapter refuses to work with Windows 10 after an update. This is why I have a separate network card plugged into my PC.
"no issues here, but i also have completely stopped updating it. Probably not a good thing but i trust myself more than MS"
I'm sure it's not as secure too because Microsoft has trained anyone who's paying attention that they should disable Windows Update entirely.
Right after I installed Windows 10 back then in the beginning I noticed my NAS drives blinking like hell. And worse of it my disk space was shrinking as hell. When I pulled the network cable I caught Superfetch crashing.  The end result was a complete crashed NAS drive that I had to reformat and reinstall the NAS OS. Luckily I still had a backup on my older drives.  The problem stopped when I put passwords on my shares and blocked Windows 10 from access to my NAS drivers. No more killing of my NAS drive has occurred.
And we know this how? I have sued 2 different employees for doing illegal shit and won.

Later on floppy drives went to half height, so you could have two in a single bay, with a hard drive in your second bay. The 3 1/2"" floppy was a later innovation."
It should be neither. Mythbusters proved how easy it was to entirely defeat these bio-metric systems. Even the ones trying to pass off as detects living tissue.

As Woody Leonhard mentioned this has historically forced MS to extend support, but I wouldn't be surprised if we got a monthly rollup with all the updates that have been put out since SP1 included.

"exactly.... lets say this was autonomous gun that fires at people for you home personal protection.... nothing wrong here fuck your driverless cars, take a fucking bus you homos"
"I don't really see that interpretation. Like the article mentions, in the official report (archived here) they observed that autopilot has already resulted in a very sharp decline in accidents. Prior to autopilot, Teslas were involved in 1.3 crashes per million miles driven. After autopilot was installed, that rate dropped to 0.8! And the vehicles have now driven billions of miles (some 2-3 hundreds of millions of miles in autopilot mode) so that's a very healthy sample. Since there is extremely good evidence that the autopilot features are already improving safety the question then becomes much easier to approach. Is any particular feature of the autopilot that would have been involved in the fatal accident behaving in a way that would expose a driver to greater than normal levels of danger? And they decided the answer to that was no. The point is ultimately that these systems are already likely safer than humans. For now the goal is to get them to be even more safe while ensuring no issues go overlooked."
"Maybe that was... murder? A whole new level and nobody could even do shit about that.  Ever seen the cop show baitcar. Consider this. The government locates said suspect they want dead, locate certain car in vicinity, over ride, run into said target. Presto. Oh it was a malfunction, Telsa takes the blame, either bails out Telsa in theoretical court case or leaves them to foot the bill, or behind the scene paying them in the pocket when they need to take one of Telsa's cars for a ""ride"". Or the most likely version. They'll just override a car make it self drive faster & into a wall, cliff ect. If you're a person of importance, stay the fuck out of a Telsa car."
I doubt that. Tesla doesn't really have finances that large to really influence this decision through corruption or mass lobbying. In fact the other car manufacturers and car dealerships have been trying to hurt Tesla and this would be great for them and they have much much more cash. Luckily the investigation was apparently fair.
Current normal car models are hackable to be remote controlled. Just search youtube. The possibility is several years old.
"I am somewhat familiar with JAWS and NVDA.  It's a situation where it's somewhat like Microsoft Office vs LibreOffice.  JAWS has bells and whistles that NVDA doesn't, and JAWS is the de-facto standard, so if you're seeking employment and you know JAWS you'll fit right in, but NVDA (in the USA) is rarely seen. The whole disability industry is very expensive, and it may seem like a rip-off but I don't think these companies are making obscene profits due to the generally low volume of sales.  I'm all for free and open source software, and people do have a choice.  The blind community is increasingly on social media etc so it's not as if they're being held hostage by the vocational rehabilitation system or whatever. It's shocking how expensive things like braille displays are, but China, Korea, etc. bringing products in have shaken things up a bit."
"All of the relevant information is publicly available and that's all these ""hackers"" were downloading anyhow. If you'd like to check out archives of pages the internet archive does a great job. For instance here is an archive of the old climate change page from Obama's presidency: https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.whitehouse.gov/energy/climate-change Trump probably removed it for ideological reasons as much as for pragmatic. In typical narcissism Obama decided to plaster pictures of himself front and center, quote himself, and talk about himself on a page that's supposed to be about climate change. I'd never actually seen the page until just now. God awful page and just absurdly political/polarizing as opposed to getting people to unite behind an important cause."
"More like ""in 1 out of 100 cases, seat belts are actually the cause of death in a car crash rather than preventing it. That's still 99 out of 100 cases where wearing a seat belt will save you."" It doesn't have to be perfect. It only has to be better than the alternative to be worth using, but human intuition is terrible at that kind of statistical judgement and so people will avoid things that will almost certainly save them, on the tiny chance that they won't."
If it wasn't clear in my comment those before and after numbers were exclusively among Tesla drivers.
"Traffic fatalities are in the ballpark of 1 per 100 million miles which is many times more than most people will ever drive during their lives. It's mostly going to come down to luck. Really I think it won't take all that much for driverless vehicles to be safer than even very good human drivers. The reason is that the difference between a driver with a perfect driving record and a driver who was just in a fatal accident is the briefest lapse of attention or even momentarily placing your attention in the wrong spot - things every human is guilty of on most every trip they make. On top of not having these issues, automated vehicles are capable of doing things that are literally impossible for humans like seeing through other vehicles, having a perfect 360 degree view at all times, and seeing in conditions in situations where it would be impossible for humans. For instance super dense fog is very difficult and very dangerous for humans but from the perspective of radar it literally doesn't even exist.  Here is a game. This is a video of a Tesla autopilot in action that also shows you a realtime view of what the autopilot sensors are detecting. The video itself is a bit accelerated. Here is a slowed down version. Watch the video in fullscreen. Each time you see an 'actor' (a person, a vehicle, etc) pause the video. You'll find you probably miss quite a lot relative to what the autopilot sees, even in what you're looking straight at. So for instance I think most humans will miss the person at  or  in the slowed video. Perfectly camouflaged and right off a view obscuring turn. The sort of scenario where accidents happen. I was definitely able to beat the autopilot on some things, but not on things that would matter. And unlike myself who's only going to get slower over time the autopilot will only get faster and more accurate over time."
"But a very good safe driver is probably still safer.  But that is the minority. If even a marginal autonomous driving system improves the figures for the bad drivers, why shouldn't we encourage it?"
You mean an idiot?
"Yeah,  solar is getting pretty well pushed by their government and anything with heavy emissions is understandably unpopular considering how bad smog has gotten in a lot of the major cities.  It'll be interesting to see how much of their energy they can account for that way."

"There was zero defect or abnormal behavior involved. This was just a one in a billion bad luck circumstance paired against a driver who was not paying attention. But as an aside, I think people don't really understand all that would go into hacking one of these vehicles. Teslas are not, by default, remotely operable. The way the demonstrated hack managed to remotely operate the car was by creating and uploading entirely new firmware. How would they get somebody to install their new firmware? Their proposed method somebody logging into a specific hotspot, and then having them navigating to a specific website with a specific browser susceptible to a specific exploit and then remaining oblivious as their firmware was rewritten and rebooted. And even if this hack was ever carried out there would be a major digital trail, 'black box' data, and more. Incidentally Tesla patched even against this esoteric vulnerability by rolling out something they had already been working on - now the vehicles will only operate signed firmwares meaning even these exploits, which in all reality pose 0 ""real"" threat, are no longer possible."
"Start on a pilots license and buy a helicopter. That is all they are going to do is replace personal helicopters.

"Currently it takes about 2 hours to reach Prague from Brno. It would take 14 minutes with the hyperloop. Airline tickets are expensive and due to the size of the airports, distance from the centre, low frequency of flights,long waiting periods on the tarmac and the fact that you lose your ticket if you miss your flight it's not really a good way to travel in these short or medium distances. The hyperloop is by far the best way to travel for large distances but for this particular track, along with the potential connection to Bratislava, Vienna or Budapest the hyperloop is by far the best option."
Only change I could see is that most don't revamp their model yearly though they do revamp them every few years. better return on the engineering budget if they run it for 3-5 before making changes then every year plus simplifies the assembly line with less changes.

"More than just that. Macs don't do as well as game machines like an ATX Windows PC because they don't allow video cards to upgrade or new CPUs with a new motherboard and RAM, etc. Which is why people are making Hackintoshes. The Mac Pro used to be ATX based, but Tim Cook changed it to a trashcan shape and no expansion slots. When the Mac first came out it used SCSI instead of expansion slots. The the Mac II series and Mac SE series had NuBus slots which helped. Which meant people could install Ethernet adapters to them and use the Macs as a server. Modern Macs are not expandable and cost too much. For myself I found that installing Linux Mint on my PC makes it faster than Windows 10 or MacOS, and Steam is releasing a lot of games for Linux now after the Windows and MacOS versions get made.

I can't comment on 2016 since I haven't used that version yet, but if you're running server and not managing it with WSUS, you're just declining to manage your updates. Having the default behavior in an enterprise environment where the administrator isn't capable of configuring updates be ""just auto update"" is probably a good thing."

Seagate on Newegg (I'm only using Newegg as the seller, and not discounted prices), 4TB $179, 8TB $399, for desktop drives that is 2x capacity and 2.2x the price. Though that drive pictured is not a desktop drive but an enterprise one according to the sticker I'll check those 4TB $399, 8TB $559, 10TB $599 so 8TB 2x capacity 1.4x price, 10TB 2.5x capacity 1.5x price those actually show some savings though this will have to come out at less then $958 to be cheaper per TB then the 10TB drives."

"Microsoft has a lot working against it though. The cult of mac and other Apple fanboys go solid on trying to degrade Microsoft. That being said Microsoft doesn't really come up with new features first it just implements other features seen elsewhere. On the rare occasion it does come one with something first, Apple does it better.  The thing I think about it the Surface with the keyboard in the cover. It flopped. Apple added it and it was a hit. I don't know what the major differences were but it flopped. When Microsoft came out with Windows mobile it sucked. They continued to refine it to make it better but IOS was superior. Then Android came out which was superior to Windows mobile. Then the new win mobile came out Windows 8 and I got a demo phone. It was snappy and looked great for a first impression. But then it had crippling limitations. You could not send an email with multiple pdf attachments. That is a crippling feature for a business phone. Then windows 10 brought a wave of negative press, annoying updates, and spying. With the negative press who wants a Microsoft product now? I certainly don't feel comfortable with using Win 10 at home due to the telemetry. I hate the idea of my habits being a product that can be sold. Microsoft isn't dead but they need a way to set themselves apart again and go in a direction that consumers want, not just businesses. I hope their supposed interest in Linux will result in a re  313b  newed interest. Apple always primarily produced products for the consumer not the company.  Microsoft really needs a division that focuses on consumer desires. I think they really did a great job with the Xbox systems. Having a social ecosystem to game in. Controllers with headsets that plugged into them. Overall a much better experience than the PS3 or the Wii. The PS4 seemed to copy the Xbox ecosystem features that made the PS4 a solid competitor. I still feel that Microsoft has a solid chance of maintaining the PC gaming market if they can stop messing up their OS with updates and scaring people off."

"Apple has enough cash to take in zero revenue and basically give their products away for many years before they go under. Doubt what you want to happen will be happening anytime soon. Apple is far too smug and makes some bad decisions and they need to mentally be taken down a peg or two and eat some humble pie once in a while. But I still think they are capable of doing good work and wouldn't totally dismiss them.  Apple is good for the industry and helps push it forward. If it wasn't for them making (what were at the time) radical moves, DVDs would have stuck around for years longer and we still might be stuck on some older ports."

It'll be interesting to see if Apple can get out of their rut or not."
"PCs and Macs can easily start piracy by installing some Bit Torrent program on them. So if someone sells a PC or Mac with the Kodi on it with plugins they too can be found of a crime?

They either said the engines were of a certain spec or the supplier of the fancier bits for the engine said they were made to spec. You might have heard it said that the cost per kilo / pound to put something into orbit well most of the costs are just building the rocket launch systems (they literally launch a rocket from a rocket from a rocket), everything has to be within a particular tolerance or spec, the first two rockets could be perfect but because one washer or nut was able to slip out of shape that 3rd rocket could have a panel deform twisting the rocket out of its flight path and two to three dozen million dollars gets wasted while everyone involved just shrugs their shoulder saying ""hey we made our part right""."

Those people are cancer in an organization and end up holding the entire group back because they can't be bothered to learn enough to move forward with the group.  People who assume ""compilers will fix it"" are just as lazy as the coaster and their effect is just as toxic. Mountains of poorly written code implemented by people who can't be bothered to learn anything about algorithms or optimization for the environment they're working in.

Further the size difference is might not be proportional to the angle. On my screen, the hand in the photo on the right is about 120 pixels, vs 140 pixels on the left  That kind of foreshortening corresponds to roughly a difference in angle of 30o, which is not what we see in the shot. In any case in the the left photo the hand should be looking shorter based on basic junior high geometry, and it is larger see this diagram https://s23.postimg.org/wtb639vwr/Trump_Hand.jpg"

I turn automatic updates on both Chromium and Failfox because I'm tired of new random features and things working then not working because someone has decided to wage their own personal e-penis war on Flash or some other added worthless feature (like removing click to play because....?). Failfox features I never wanted list quite high.

It's 2017 and I am once again loading multiple web browsers because both render the same content differently (Failfox happens to render it like ass, all jaggy and whatnot), while Chromium runs it smoothly and makes it look smooth.

There is a topological argument for cable.  You can distribute over 100 channels in HD to 1000s of homes with no need for two way communication between the client and server per home added.  You just modulate each of the signals on top of eachother and run that through relays to 1000s of homes at once.

"These days? Sure. Install Ubuntu. Put all the important icons on the desktop— so I'm assuming just Chrome; and maybe setup the Facebook integration for her, if she's in to that. The install itself should be nothing more than choosing a password. After that, you have to make sure she presses the ""ok"" button on the update window, whenever it pops up. That's about it."
"If your motherboard/cpu are capable of enabling hardware virtualization compatibility, you can run all that stuff on a Windows virtual machine that loads within Linux— with unnoticeable performance difference. Use that for the things you can't live without, replace everything else with FOSS within Linux itself."
"Mine was, 10 years ago.  It's actually way easier to maintain, you can do most of it remotely, and don't have to worry about her blowing shit up by accident."
Look into Wine. It can run a lot of Windows programs. I personally dual-boot because Windows is still better for gaming. My laptops run solely Linux though.
"It's been easier than Windows for years. No rooting through the internets looking for drivers, everything just works. Or doesnt, if you see what I mean."

"I set up my mother with it a few years ago on a free laptop from Craigslist and she's been surfing the web since, with only occasional need to fix an issue (though a hard reboot is usually all it takes, when some website confuses the browser). It's pretty solid, especially since it won't succumb to Windoze malware."
"I'd also assume that major distributions are backdoored and that if one cared that much about it one would have to go through major work to do a solid compile of one. EDIT: downvoat, is it because the beloved Linux and distributions cannot be criticized? I wouldn't choose any other OS/kernel, but won't lie to myself about the likely reality. I prefer the nitty gritty reality and juggling tradeoffs when making choices, rather than imagined black-and-white fictions."
"I am like pretty sure that Lenart Pottering (you piece of shit) is being paid millions to disrupt the Linux community and introducing unnecessary complexity just so that NSA can exploit it.  This is interesting. There are those who believe that Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell and other Core contributors who work for Blockstream are being paid off by certain powerful interests to do pretty much the same thing to the Bitcoin codebase, though not necessary to create a backdoor, but rather to hurt the development of bitcoin as a money. Fortunately it seems that the community is giving them the finger in favor of a new development team. It would be very surprising if the usual suspects were not actively trying to fuck with all sorts of FOSS, given how much is at stake.  Edit: And of course here come the shills to downvoat the truth. Give it up guys. You lost. The signal will not be stopped."
"Impressed with the transparency, but, as the person who would be responsible for fixing such an issue at my workplace, nothing is few things are as aggravating as giving constant progress reports to luddites when you're trying to focus on fixing a major issue in a high stress situation."
It looks like game pieces to me.
"Yeah how many people boast about using Linux and then still use Chrome, Gmail, & Google everything else including DNS."
"Theres a difference between the targeted focus of infilitrating a high value Linux target, and the catch-all, fuck-everyone panopticon known as Microsoft Windows."
"My 72 year old mother used it for the last couple of years on one of my Debian spares after her Windows laptop croaked (she got an ipad for Christmas this year, doesn't like it better, but it was a gift). When you're not doing much but netsurfing and email, playing solitaire, and using stuff like ebay it's not that hard to get up to speed on a modern distribution these days."
"You're kidding yourself if you think that's anywhere near voluntarily letting Microsoft, Google, and Apple get all your data and legally giving it to the government. Do you really think hardware backdoors are being utilized 24/7 for everyone or even more than a select few that are targeted?"
"I also have several systems, and need to find things that work on older systems because clients ¯_(ツ)_/¯"
"If your granny only needs to run a browser and type letters in a decent word processor, the unequivocal answer is yes, at least if she's already able to use Windows.  Most distros will do a fantastic job of this right out of the box, and if she's using a distro designed for end users and not a whiz-bang, cutting-edge computer, it'll probably make all the right decisions during installation and come up with no problem on the first try.  I've been hearing for years about people swapping out broken Windows installs for Ubuntu or Mint for elderly relatives and having fantastic success, and from what I've seen, I believe it. Things get more complicated from there.  Linux is great, but it has some very serious gaps for some markets.  These seem to fall into the middle of the spectrum in terms of uses.  For complicated uses where you need something heavy-duty and able to keep up with the computer science majors, Linux is great.  If you need an appliance where things ""just work"" or something to run a relatively standard set of applications (specifically a web browsers, LibreOffice, and other ""standard"" programs in distros) and someone else (specifically the manufacturers) set it up already, Linux is great. If you want more middle-range desktop work or a light, stupid-simple server, things get more dicey, and you might be in for a rough time if you aren't willing or able to learn (and I do acknowledge there are people who have good reasons not to want to learn Linux)."
"Sometime ago, a some NSA guy said that it is not impossible to snoop on Linux users. And they do.  Anyone who says that anything is, in practice, hack proof, is probably full of crap.  It's kind of like what happens when you declare a ship unsinkable; in most cases, you will come to rue those words. There are a lot of people who insist Linux is as bad as Windows.  Frankly, I don't believe that.  But it also is no panacea.  I wish people would stop believing it was; it is a great improvement for privacy, but there are limits.  And I can gurantee that code scrutinization is a Herculean task and 99.9% of Linux users never look at the code before installing, even the source code based distros like Gentoo.  I have no idea of how many millions of lines of code there are in a typical Linux distribution.  At least on the order of several tens of millions.  I would assume over a hundred million easily.  You could spend a lifetime trying to audit that much code by yourself.  OSS has many benefits, but unless you are interested in a specific portion of all that code, the end user being able to (theoretically) verify the software themselves is almost certainly not one of them.  I am like pretty sure that Lenart Pottering (you piece of shit) is being paid millions to disrupt the Linux community and introducing unnecessary complexity just so that NSA can exploit it.  I doubt it.  IMO, there are other forces in play here, and I suspect that something foul is going on with the way it's being shoved down everyone's throats even though it seems like almost everyone utterly loathes it who isn't a distribution developer.  That said, that might just make the job easier for anyone who wants to get into your computer, because all they have to do is sit back and watch for vulnerabilities to spring up in the new code.  And above all, there are binary blobs in the firmware.  This is a huge problem with Intel.  Unfortunately it will be some time before open source hardware becomes really practical, unless you're willing to go with considerably weaker CPUs (which, with current computing hardware, is sometimes just fine; a CHIP works fine for simple office tasks, for instance, and the whole thing is $10 or so).  LibreBoot was arguably a step in the right direction, but aside from being politicized up the wazoo, it's not enough, and I don't even think it necessarily works with modern hardware anyway, which makes its utility somewhat limited.  That said, if Intel's secrets on their firmware ever make it out into public and we have nearly undefeatable hacking tools spreading like mad, this business is going to get really nasty for them, really quickly.  Corporations and the government are extremely powerful, but not omnipotent, and the sudden outrage of literally almost everyone who uses a computer (or used what is now a paperweight) might be enough to change things dramatically."

"wort wəːt/￼ noun suffix: -wort; noun: wort; plural noun: worts 1. used in names of plants and herbs, especially those used formerly as food or medicinally, e.g. butterwort, lungwort, woundwort. archaic a plant or herb used as food or medicinally. 2. the sweet infusion of ground malt or other grain before fermentation, used to produce beer and distilled malt liquors.

"I found this thread to see if Vivaldi still does that. https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/5049/why-does-vivaldi-connect-to-these-ips-on-startup/20 TL;DR: The Google IP addresses it contacts are for Google's Phishing and Malware protection feature, aka Safe Browsing. The 2nd page mentions how that is obviously used by Google to produce a list of URLs you visit, in what order, and they almost certainly sell that information. I mean... if I'm going to bother worrying about my browser contacting Google, I'll just block those IP addresses."
AT&T actually has been laying a lot of fiber for several years now with their U-verse service. Then they started making bold announcements. https://arstechnica.com/business/2014/04/att-copies-google-names-100-cities-where-it-could-offer-gigabit-fiber/ Part of their problem is while laying fiber they for their ISP services they also had to replace the cables going into their cell towers. A lot of them were still running on old T1 line bundles. Those were swapped out with simple Cat5 bundles giving massive bandwidth boosts. AT&T also has a lot of places where they literally just connected their ancient DSL lines from the early 2000s to the U-verse nodes as a stop gap. So I really hope they're eying those areas for fiber sooner than later. If AT&T doesn't screw anything up by the end of 2018 they'll actually be in a very good position. https://www.att.com/internet/gigapower.html

Probably a typographical error. That should be MacOS.
"The only problem I see is that this doesn't guarantee higher salaries for american workers, or even more jobs. it's just cutting salaries for foreign workers.  Being profit-driven as corporations tend to be, they'll just move the positions elsewhere."

Optional. We're not talking about Microshaft here.
"Well my first thought when seeing vending machine is ""Dont really want to use it because it might just eat up my money and do nothing"" With this im thinking ""Cool lets see a robot make coffee"". I guess it gives you more confidence when you see it being made. It makes it more trustworthy, more personal... i dont know."
"One reason: old bosses. I used it until this year because publishers and bosses would demand it. They were old and technologically retarded, but they had jobs for life. I'm sure they were really invested in the MSOrifice vs. WurdPerfect debate in 1995, but now they'd decided decisions had been made; they're pressing on in the name of progress."
Another reason: Office is way easier to automate with .NET than libreoffice is with anything.
"You're right to ask the question, but I'm not qualified to provide a complete and accurate answer. The one rule which seems to apply to cryptography is that it only delays attackers, but when properly applied it can delay attackers more effectively and for longer than the popular alternatives (obfuscation for example)."
Maybe they thought it was twice as good on Windows. Then they found it wasn't.  Edit: added 'on' and missing 'y' in 'they'.
"Personally, I'd recommend Protonmail over Tutanota but both seem to be good options. Maybe get an account at each and see which you like better."
I've actually had very few bugs with LO. Even their major point releases are stable enough to use in everyday work. I've had a few crashes over the years but I think that's mostly because I'm always running the bleeding-edge on my Ubuntu machine using the beta PPA (i.e. it isn't even intended for general use).
"I don't think there's any need to read so much oppression and manipulation into it. It's a coming-of-age story of a girl who prefers action to needlework and must work to redefine her relationship with her well-meaning but overbearing mother. The king and queen provide a realistic (for a cartoon) portrayal of traditional masculine and feminine modes of power, and commentary on the complementary nature of both and the strengths and weaknesses of each. The overarching morality play is a traditional message that we must embrace growth and change but have a right to do so on our own terms. 8/10 I liked it so sue me."
"Office loads a little quicker, and excel's ui is nicer than calc, but libreoffice fills my needs pretty well. If I need something with more performance node & python fill in nicely."
Unrestorable backups don't count so  ffa   yeah it is.
Was going to say this can't be right. If there is even a possibility that the system could lock people in their rooms under any circumstances there's no way that's going to pass any kind of safety inspection.
"Comcast at least provided somewhat decent speeds.  Still though, their execs should be hog tied and ass-reamed with a cactus.  ATT on the other hand is just laughable.  I have fiber and the fuckers keep sending me 'offers' to switch to their blazing fast 3Mbps high speed line for just $20 more than I pay my fiber company per month."
"Woah take off your tinfoil hat, bro, that will NEVER happen! /s And people didn't believe that they would have ads in their OS either..."
"You come off as smug about your use of linux, don't worry as more people jump to it so will the malware.

"The repos weren't affected. It was just some user data like comments and issues. They did bring the web service down though, so you couldn't push."
"It's amazing that people still us MS Office.  As someone into publications/documentation, here's why:  Document reviewing Automation of tasks using macros Document versioning Formatting images within a document  ...and many more features. Libre office still have a longgg way to go when it comes to enticing us folks in the publishing industry and make a switch."
I'm shocked that they would even mention Linux as a supported option for Windows XP users. Not that I'm against Linux; I am running an encrypted instance to type this!
Backblaze discusses that here:  https://www.backblaze.com/blog/3tb-hard-drive-failure/
Enterprise environment the number of XP is still enormous for the simple fact that it drives old hardware and runs old software. You are wrong to assume that everyone runs Office.
"Its scary that so many people don't understand the dangers of ""linking"" their name and email address with the operating system, enabling the vendor to monitor everything that they do and associate collected data with an actual human being."

Honestly I'd be more in favor of something that gets damn near the karman line and flies more or less a ballistic trajectory. That's probably the most efficient way to do it. Plus it's something like a 90 minute travel time from New York to Tokyo.

"The best part about Windows 95 was not needing to set ""active hours"" or worry about data collection and intrusive advertising. I would seriously use a version of Windows 95 that was retrofitted to support modern hardware and software before I would willingly use Windows 10."
A big part of me thinks that web-browsers are a false path---too many different data formats and protocols to make them auditable and safe. There is just too much complexity in one web application to make them secure and useful. Perhaps we should all be reexamining the UNIX philosophy of one-tool-doing-one-thing-well.

My bad. I posted it on mobile from my feed reader. Here's the plain URL - http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/02/how-to-enable-libreoffice-ribbon-notebook-bar
That's why LibreOffice is introducing it as an option. It will never replace the current. There are also 2 other new interfaces but the ribbon is what people are familiar with.
"The freedom of privacy is the more important issue.  Kid diddling is fucked for sure, but it's not an issue that can ruin modern free western society.  I am 100% against pedophilia, but not at the cost of freedom.  Similarly I am against unprovoked gun violence or armed robbery, but not at the cost of the second amendment."
Agreed.  This should NEVER be the default.
"The Indian coding team is too busy coding things that cause total OS crashes every month to be concerned about a bug that existed probably for 20+ years (older than the coders). Also, this would imply they knew how to fix it."
That might change when Ahmed is the one serving the drinks. This is just a pilot though. The tech will get cheaper and more efficient very quickly. In five years you might be asking why you would pay more for Mohammed to be pouring those drinks.
Automats. They were staffed by cooks behind the set of windows to refill each cubby. Not really automated per se.

"Exactly. Part of the experience of eating or drinking at an establishment is the service. The robot arm is just a decadent novelty when vending machines serve hot coffee already.  If we're on the verge of mass automation, one of the survivors of the human service industry will be the coffee shop. Unless or until robots become really advanced."
"Yup, IMO epaper is the better consumer-friendly solution for most reusable literature, such as with books. Also with traditional printing, paper can be recycled and there are non-toxic inks, such as from soy. Also, if this new stuff is cheap, then lazy folks will still tend to through it away and even burn it when they are done. Also, to reuse this stuff, I imagine it won't help if it gets folded/bent and such. Also, unlike epaper in books and magazines, with this light paper you would need to unbind each page to reprint it, one page at a time. That said, there are big markets for this still, such as with merchandising displays, select office/school literature, as a cheaper alternative to traditional copy machines and desktop printers, and to replace thermal printing. I don't know, but I guess the main advantage to this light printing is speed. I Imagine the printing process will be very fast, cheap, clean, and won't require as much space or skilled labor."
"Exactly. While people here rejoice at the loss of jobs for those they perceive as 'enemies', the only winners are the elites."
"No it won't, you fucking buggywhip guys are annoying. There will be a period of volitility during the changes to industries but regardless of your Blade Runner dystopian future LARPING, automation is not going to do that. Seriously don't be retarded, Everytime we upgrade people like yourself shout the sky is falling. In the end, it will always benefit the majority."

"No it is not. There has yet to be a program developed which can show an understanding of anything. Finding patterns in data is not analysis.

If you are looking for online docs take a look at Zoho, Apple's iCloud, and Dropbox's new Paper app. If it's storage you're after there are a zillion options."
"This is an excellent read.  Assange writes well, and despite the occasional ad hominem and unnecessary adjective, concentrates on delivering the facts.  You are then allowed to make up your own mind as to what Schmidt and Google are up to."
"the article title was very clickbaity but reading through the kickstarter page and seeing the demos in action makes it look really cool. like someone else said here - it caches upload/downloads, encrypts stuff, lets you recall stuff, and gives you remote access to access files not in the cloud piece. Their caching demo reminds me of the scene in office space where the guy is trying to save something at 5pm before the boss shows up and the progress bar is taking forever edit: wrong reply. The terabyte thing was dubious, looks like their platform doesn't have ""arbitrary"" file size limitations."
Can't hear the city officials over the sound of the enormous drill.
Lol.
"These channels are great, some of the scammers freak out when they know they're made and go on verbal yelling meltdowns for minutes at a time in broken English."
"Well as most employers are bad actors then tough I guess. If they behaved like good corporate citizens then maybe they wouldn't be necessary. But in a lot of industries, especially IT they're sorely needed to prevent wage theft, exploitation, and other legal matters where a singular person simply can't win."
"Technically it is possible, but usefulness is questionable. For example, you can compress a 1TB file, consisting of a certain repeated patterns/symbols, down to manageable size. You can then stream/transmit the ""1TB file"" while decompressing."
Good let's hope it costs them a shitload. First in a losing fight then all the costs you mention plus whatever it raises their labor costs. If more money ends up in the hands of the Democrat Party so much the better.
"Same here. Also, the article seems to be written by a schizophrenic with random words thrown laptop around throughout cheap the article. (Like what I just did portable.)"
Good guess.
"I don't even trust the galvanized finishing nails they make because they SUCK so bad. 5-6 bend completely before being hammered into wood. Their pharmaceutical stuff somehow turns out decent/good though (pill making). I just really don't think I want to trust them working with metals aside from the silver smithing (FF dictionary did not know what smithing is...? The fuck?) they used to be famous for. Seriously, they still use tire rims based off the multiple pieces held together with metal hoops."
This is brilliant! Eye tracking blog platform that does not allow comments to be posted until entire article is read. I want to sign up to that site.
"I want to know how they convinced a group of law makers to legally mandate they have >10% PROFIT (You want to know how rare 10%+ profit actually is in any mature industry? I don't mean digital bullshit either) after all other expenses and they somehow made it so I have to pay for other expenses I had no hand in creating as part of my power bill. I'm vehemently against private owned utilities. That is what SoCal Edison is, I don't care how they word it. It's a fucking slush fund and people are getting paid quite a bit at all our expense. I can only imagine the bribes."
Corruption is a serious problem. Along with that greed thing.
"Not just that. Also there is a reason I always set Windows (not 10) resource management to server mode (background services rather than programs active). Most games rely on the .dll thing that is Windows which is a cluster fuck of shared resources and your game likely uses many of them along with various other random because why not shit in the background that if you make the game a higher priority than making sure that shit gets the needed CPU time, then your game has possible random hiccups in performance as a result. Sorry I don't think I can really word it better and it still feels a tad off. Honestly that is how that shit pulls resources though. Rare cases I did have better performance making the games thread priority higher were because those games themselves are coded 1/2 assed."
"I'm trying to fathom how they are going to make compiled code not run on something that understands said code and runs it. That literally requires adding shit to the program to check what OS the program is being installed/ran on and telling the installer/program to quit if it detects the OS to not be one of the ""preferred"" OSes."
"Stream it from a computer using bluetooth, or plug in a USB hard drive using USB C."
My dad is this lunatic who feeds into these scams and wastes weeks of their time and scams them of money.
..nearly 75% of the time
"If the city council approves it yeah. You have to back your shit up with sound engineering though, and this project would require a shit load of geotech work. If he didn't get it approved he's liable for some serious fines, especially considering he may be running this thing under some highly built up areas and depending on the depth, could adversely affect existing construction, which would have to be planned for, he has to plan ventilation, service tunnels, lighting, fire control, emergency evac, etc, etc. Honestly it's a really stupid idea. I mean Seattle tried to dig a new tunnel and they got the TBM stuck for two years because they hit preexisting construction remnants and damaged the cutter. I don't know how this guy makes his money, but the way he spends it is fucking absurd."
I gots to know.
If they're not released on the first half of this year I'll agree with you. So far they seem to be on track.
"That was one of my faves too. The ""snot bubble"" was good too."
You need competent humans to program said AI. Good luck finding those in the tech industry that is too much about profit and not enough about paying competent people the money they deserve.
"The problem with ideas like ""the greater good"" is the same as being totally selfish. A totally self interested AI could say ""Fuck All Humans!""  These idea are sometimes seen as opposite side of a coin or competing ideas, etc. This is wrong There needs to be a balance and coordination of competing interests (personal vs tribe vs country, etc)  It's more like a philosophic rubic's cube."
That person has obviously never won anything
Sadly unlike THQ they don't produce exclusively shovelware.
crack addiction?
It's sarcasm... Or not? Sure hope it is.
"We previously saw this problem with ""racial profiling"" and these days with ""religious profiling"" A power play of some sort"
I was an Intel user. Went for the brand known for power. Did a minor upgrade on my pc.  Went with AMD  to save money since this was an older system. On paper Intel might be faster but I honestly can't tell the difference. Especially with these last two or three generations the jump in performance hasn't been like it was in the past. Seems silly to me now to opt fo the high end chips or fuss with overclocking unless you're after bragging rights of some sort.  I think I'm set for at least another 3  and possibly even more.
I don't think people understand just how old and awesome this comment is.
"Blaming a team for sucking donkey dick is the easy answer man, lol. Fuck these whiny asshats.  Blown calls suck, i get that. Im still pissed over the steelers win over the cards, but ya know what? I blamed the players and the refs, not black people. But thats me and im logical."
"And a solution to China's air pollution problem, too - LOL!"
"Got me, but you're probably right."
