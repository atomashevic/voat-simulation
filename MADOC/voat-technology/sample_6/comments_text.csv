Moore's law is alive and well.  The next step is stacking transistors similar to current non-volatile memory structures.  That should buy us another 10 years or so.  After that who knows which tech will replace silicon.
When you start letting in mass unskilled immigrants from the very countries that are breeding the terrorists then you know something smells.

"yes, NVidia burned a lot of good will with the ""4GB"" stunt. It will be a long time before I support NVidia again, and frankly I hope that AMD kicks their ass. AMD has been very generous with video memory as of late, packing up to 8GB on affordable cards, while NVidia was busy selling GTX960s at $220 with 2GB of memory like its 2012 and screwing over customers who got the 970."

"I remember listening to a seal talk about how we didn't take terrorism seriously enough 10 years after 9/11. That we didn't go far enough to prevent more happening in the US. We needed another attack to make us really nut up and start fixing hte problem: Islam. This was before I got fully redpilled. (Again, thanks for helping me on that path voat, love you guys you damn nigger fuckers) He and I got into many discussions on it. I was arguing that keeping the asshats from coming into the country would do a lot to keep attacks from happening in the US.  He stuck to: the idealogy can broach borders if there is a receiver already in country.  I knew domestically grown jihadists could be made, was too easy to see it happening.  But, knowing the raw restrictions on buying large quantities to do anything truly devastating would be hard I kept it up. Now, years later and seeing what's going on in Europe and how the asshats have evolved strategies. That navy pillow biter was fucking right.  They swapped over to nickel and dime attacks.  They will start more of it in the US when it serves them best. It isn't a question of 'if' but 'when' and 'how'.  You really want to see this happen? Watch the redpilling begin?  Make sure you capture this moment. Screenshot, put it in a picture frame and when, WHEN, it happens you point at this right here ""As long as Islam exists in the western world, there will be no peace in westernized society."""

"The intern makes note of whatever you call about. Each caller represents a fraction of all of the people who dont bother to call. Calling multiplies the perceived public opinion on any given topic. I have talked in person to senators about various topics interesting to me, and they are certainly not versed in pretty much anything. They want to know voters' positions and MAYBE a fee talking points. Even if you could speak directly to them you wpuldnt get much put of it."

"The 5.0 spec is coming in 2019 is my understanding. It'll be a couple more years before you really start seeing a lot of products utilizing it.

I should have found this article and posted it. https://techreport.com/news/32064/pcie-4-0-specification-finally-out-with-16-gt-s-on-tap Probably see some 4.0 products start trickling out near the end of this year."
That is truly a work of art.

"The ""sexualization"" knee-jerk reaction comes from the feminist brainwashing dictating females should look and act like strong independent /males/ and everything that reveals them as feminine is against that, because it reminds them of the ""dominating nature"" of males as having a healthy and natural male-female bond is toxic.. and of course males should become gay and trans so women can feel superior and break the chains of the patriarchy!!!!! They don't need men when they can live ""independent"" on their own, and they don't need to pump out babies that leach their precious time and money. Even fat and ugly women are still women and men are pigs for not liking them, that's inequality! Women should be the one who hunt their partners because they know it best. We live in current year and old traditions are OLD!!! we need to be more progressive, you see!!!"

"I absolutely abhor the notion that the government should dictate the morals of the people. Not only it's totalitarian, it's been proven to make things far, far worse time and time again. Drug abuse, suicide epidemic, social retreat, ""degeneracy"" and many others are no more than symptoms of huge and complex problems that our societies have been trying to ignore because they have no easy solutions or are just too hard to understand. Sick societies create sick individuals, sick individuals are attracted to addictions and destructive practices while healthy ones are immune to them.  Dealing only with the symptoms invariably makes the original problem worse. Just take the misguided war on drugs for an example of how utterly disastrous this mentality can get. Be careful labeling ""Degeneracy"" (and similar problems) as the root of our problems, not only the shortsightedness of this has caused problems in the past but also you may walking the same line of thought behind the repugnant ""SJWs"" crying/bullying about racism, misogyny, etc."

"The most hilarious thing is that his tobacco analogy backfires on him almost as soon as he makes it: I don't know 100% if there was anything specific to smokeweed, but ag gag laws were all over the US at one point.

"Your second bit is absolutely correct. A lot of things naturally become centralized. They always have and always will. That's just reality. If Wal-Mart didn't have so many products from so many categories then there would obviously be less one-stop-shopping there and shopping would be less centralized (until a similar place pops up). If Facebook wasn't so widely used then other options would be more viable for people who want to use a social network to communicate with most people they know. Villiages form because its convenient and beneficial for a myriad of reasons to have a centralized location versus individual people/families having to travel some distance. Same for cities and so on up the tree. Companies have owners/boards/etc. to manage business with the benefit of the company in mind. Social groupings of people such as cities have leaders/councils to manage society and enterprise, ideally with the benefit of the populus in mind. Once either type of group starts to have negative effect, the supporting contributors must take action or withdraw contribution to correct such. Complacency is how things go awry and snowball into Facebook, etc. Physically decentralizing data flow and storage can help to minimize potential for its misuse, but centralization will always come and go at every level. Just some thoughts."
"FYI one of the key tenets of the maven is that users get to control and keep the data of the base they have created.  Whereas a company like Facebook keeps all the data and only gives you limited access, the maven has a mission where you will control your user data and can take that data with you if you choose to leave their platform.  This is a huge shift from what companies like Facebook and google do now."

I think the people are the problem. Government is an euphemism for a certain group of people who banded together to steal from the others. It's that  3ae4   simple. The deplorables need to realize the answer is a simple one: reject the status quo. It doesn't even need a majority. 3-4% opposition is all it takes. Why do you think the oligarchs spend so much effort squashing dissent? It's because it doesn't take much for deplorables to see others making a difference.
"""their"" ? Who exactly are you referring too ?   Are you talking about the people that put listening devices into my walls to spy on me ?!?!?!?!"

"if we can communicate anonymously.  It used to just be assumed that all open communication on the internet was anonymous, you might not really be hiding your identity but you sure as hell did go posting under your own name. Fucking jews at facebook have changed that."
Exactly.  Decentralisation through government oversight is an ideological oxymoron. It's equivalent to having a group stay together by splitting up. If this guy thinks moving the power from singular entities like corporations to singular entities like governments counts as decentralisation then he needs to go read a dictionary.

"Came here to post this, but this was posted much more eloquently than I would have. On another point, though...  Sunde still doesn't understand that government is the problem, and phrases it as if companies which we have a choice to ignore are the problem. He's blaming the victim, which is odd for somebody who's been so victimized by legislation himself.  What I don't get is why Sunde would propose ""more government"", when the original Netizen/Net Pirate ideology was based around a much more anarchistic base. He says he wants less centralization, but by involving government more, the only thing his suggestion does is centralize things even more, whether by government control of speech online, censorship by unmasking of anonymous speech, or by cronyistic policies allowing near-monopolistic oligopolies in each region. He's betraying everything the original hacker ethic stood for, in this statement, and it makes me wonder if he's been compromised."

"The thing is coding stays the same, these kind of programs never work because people wont admit that only   a certain amount of the population actually has the aptitude to code.  You know how people in their 50's call millennials  ""tech savvy"" because they can perform basic tasks on a computer ?   thats what is happening to code.  As an engineer its great for business, the pool of competitors keeps shrinking and my wages keep rising, A fun fact is that most people who can write software well usually retire early or end up contracting at exorbitant rates as actual tech skills are super high in demand.  Infact most server work is ""infra as code"" now meaning that the bar for sysadmins is much higher than it used to be."

"It's a dangerous precedent to set for interbusiness relations. Imagine you had a small business that was starting up or struggling, then had a backer like Amazon come in offering you money. You're going to have to pony up collateral for that transaction, and that'll likely be controlling interest. Amazon is well on its way to being a conglomerate, and only a matter of time before it starts hedging on monopoly territory."
"On the flip side, 3D printing companies are going belly up from too much competition making it impossible to stay profitable as they all race to the bottom with paper thin margins.

What we desperately need is a grass roots project."
"even I understand how a search engine works     Making ""a search engine"" is not actually that hard.  Making one you'd find USEFUL is.  You have two major challenges: indexing the web in a way that is useful (a reasonably solved problem, but still expensive to implement) and actually delivering useful searches quickly.  You can get ""quickly"" by spending money, but being as USEFUL as Google is really really difficult."

The point is to make it easy for the government to imprison anyone they wish--as well as make demands of corporations so that they can get more data, power, and influence. They're using the currently fashionable weapons of political correctness to lever corporations into positions that are more advantageous for the tyrants in power. Prepare for: ""Put that phone down, native German citizen! You were caught posting Islamaphobic hatethoughts on Facebook, who holds an exclusive government contract with us mandating the disclosure of all malcontents. And because you shared your comment using a side-loaded illegal encryption app, it bumps your crime up to 10 years minimum, with mandatory backdated paycheck garnishment. Now relinquish the money you stole from the government and tell your wife to go find a nice Muslim husband."""

"Hi, im an electronic engineer. Here's a few things about wireless energy: If there isn't a receiving antenna, made of metal, in a very specific shape, pointed to a specific direction. The energy from the transmitter doesn't leave, it doesn't go anywhere.  The shape must be of a coil, with very many and tight windings, something not usually found in the human body. If a recieving antenna is not present, the transmitting antenna doesn't even emit power, as it wouldn't have a path and would cause electrical losses (in the form of heat). To keep the thing from burning, it only emits the signal when activated by the presence of an rfid. But even if it was always on, the human body cannot receive this energy. This is physics, meaning, not disputable. But, lets say you've got a titanium hip replacement. There's a tiny tiny spring inside and it's pointed towards the transmitter,  the other end of spring is not in contact with the hip chassis, but is inside flesh, presumably a malfunction, a painful medical error. Let's also assume the transmitter is also dysfunctional, and is always on.  Now you can get cancer.... but if never charging my car or phone means you get cancer, i do not care about your cancer."
Well what did you expect from a greedy kike.
Most definitely yes. Don't expect a propaganda source to post much of the truth.
"Yep, you are correct"
Probably wouldn't even need to get into the router if they can get into the network.
"I disagree with a few of these points. The docs list this as the typical means of infection: ""...either using the Claymore tool or via a supply chain operation"" We don't yet know what 'Claymore' is, but a 'supply chain operation' would be the CIA implanting it either with complicit vendors or by intercepting devices in-transit before they're sold. All-in-all, that's not all that far fetched but probably not what is happening for most people. You often don't need physical or wireless access to compromise a router. Typically, this is when the devices don't protect against something called cross-site request forgery (CSRF). These attacks originate from a site on the Internet, which calls back to your router to make some sort of state-changing action on the device. Often you need to be logged into your router for this to work, because the browser will include your session information along with any requests, even from external locations. That's not always the case though... I've found issues in recent history that don't require you to be logged into the device, although generally it has to be chained together with other vulnerabilities (like debug functionality left on the device, which happens quite often). CSRF is hard to fully explain, but if you want to read up more about it, check out   this. Just to speculate, 'Claymore' could be something like an 0-day in, for instance, the lighttpd web server. You know, a web server developed by a handful of people on a volunteer basis and used on probably a majority of these sorts of devices."

"I remember a post on isohunt.com now isohunt.to that said something like ""unless the paid for services offer something better than the free services people won't stop pirating"" this post was from years ago but always stuck with me. I couldn't imagine paying a large bill to watch a show filled with ads while the pirate version had ads removed and was in 2 minutes on demand. With that said I still pay for Netflix just for convenience and price .. $10 a month and I watch old forensic files episodes no buffering no commercials all sorted and listed properly. I could pirate these I'm sure but the service of Netflix is actually benefitting me in some way so I pay the reasonable fee"

"Because this is more a change showing a direction for the government to go in, rather than a huge time-saving measure:  The agency didn‚Äôt provide an estimate of how much time is currently spent on Y2K paperwork, but Linda Springer, an OMB senior adviser, acknowledged that it isn‚Äôt a lot since those requirements are already often ignored in practice. Mulvaney said he hopes that by publicly eliminating the rules, departments and agencies will be inspired to review their own policies and procedures to reduce inefficiencies.  Elsewhere in the article they mention that it could save tens of thousands of man hours though, but then again the government is massive and that could just be a few hours a year per department. Still, seems like a no-brainer and might inspire some more serious cuts."

All this so i can leave the news on one TV while i do whatever on my HTPC/tablet/phone.  So my options are to either pay overages on my internet which are sometimes less than the Sat TV bill or pay the Satellite company directly and have a better quality picture that's quicker and easier to use.

"The city is planning to lease out the fiber to ISPs while specifically refusing to offer exclusivity to any one company. They're also working to ensure new companies can have fair access to public wiring poles that could be used to support the new company's infrastructure. I hadn't heard of the 'One Touch Make Ready' policy before. Looks like the idea is that all companies using the poles agree to use a common maintenance crew who has the right to adjust the wiring/setup as necessary so when new competitors come in, they can get their hardware setup and competing with minimal barriers to entry. So no, most of these actions are specifically geared towards breaking down the current monopolies which is probably wired they're being sued by Time Warner and AT&T while being opposed by astroturfed lobbying."

I use Amazon to connect with small businesses selling obscure products and then I buy directly from the small business. Good times.
Since the Amazon market place works just like Ebay. I think that the issue I you're having is not due to Amazon themselves but rather due to people having figured ways to game the system. How would it serve their interest to sell you the cheaper version of a product when there is a more expensive version and thus a greater percentage for them?  Your complaint is basically that they keep directing you to whoever sells some widget the cheapest. Which doesn't really sound like a problem and is probally more down to the fact that if people are going to buy something they're naturally going to get it at the cheapest possible price.
Which is fine.  They're efforts are better allocated elsewhere.  That's why they as employees cost money and why automation pays.  No prospect at a second job equals no automation.  They will be fine (if they choose to be).
"Well if there is it is only because we have negative interest rates compared to inflation available to not only banks but now it is very commonly available to business.  We have companies with zero revenue hoping to become unicorns (billion dollar ipo).  One day we are going to realize pipedreams weren't productive and scarcity and the need to actually produce something will catch up to us.  That labor reallocation is called a recession because people can't all find the useful jobs all at once, and people spend less while they perform that search, and people spend less while under threat that they may have to, and businesses spend less when they have to think about cashflow instead of line of credit. It's like hating holacaust but loving immigration.  The circumstance that called for the thing you hate was avoidable.  You actually have a moral obligation to avoid these kinds of things in the long run and not just oppose them directly."
"This is a great thing though. Other groceries have had automated self checkout for a decade, Whole Foods has been slow to institute this. Any automation should slowly lower the cost of goods in the store."

"Or you have sites selling items at double to triple the prices of Walmart and Target. Don't believe me compare the prices of Tide. I get questions from reviews I wrote 2+ years ago just because of the prices I listed. I had to go back and update several reviews to explain that Amazon had stopped carrying items directly. Cascadian Farm Organic Cinnamon Crunch is very good, just not $5 per box good.  Amazon dumped many food & home care products that I know were selling because I fond them through the very popular slickdeals.net. I hate Walmart but I'll buy a fair amount of items through them, especially food related, before I hit up Amazon. Free ship to store so I can pick up a package with all my stuff two days later vs a week later at my door does make a difference."

That's the first thing I thought of.
Every free product has to cover costs somehow.
"Looked at the pricing section and they do have a 'free' option. Slow speed, 1 device, only 3 countries to choose from. On the plus side though they claim they keep no logs."
Your paid VPN probably allows you to get higher speeds and greater variety of countries to choose from.
"It's free in the sense that it's a loss leader for the paid service.    It's going to be grindingly slow on purpose so you get fed up and start to think that $4 (or $8, $24) for high speed multi country support isn't that bad a deal. It's the same with ZenMate (also ""free"").    I have the paid service.  It's pretty good.   Especially like the android app."
"When it comes to VPNs free means shit speeds, but it gets the job done. Paid ones mean you get to download Hillary Clinton's emails in less than a second and spend the whole afternoon puking to her nudes."
The free one is going to have shit speeds and not be nearly as nice as the paid one. They do have a pricing section so after using the free one you can upgrade to a paid nicer one. I'm going to use it until i can get a paid one anyways.

"that car is not autonomous, it broadsided a fucking 18-wheeler instead of just stopping. it just has an auto run feature that turns."
Beep boop?
"Tesla is very clear about the car's capabilities and the driver's responsibilities, and there are a bunch of different warnings that progressively escalate until it's blaringly screaming at you and slowly bringing the car to a full stop. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Unless the car were to suddenly dart into incoming traffic without giving the person time to correct, which it doesn't do unless some three letter agency gets their grubby little hands on it, unless it does that, you've got to be a full blown idiot to get in a wreck with it. In any case fully autonomous driving is set to be released soon, and it's on a separate development track that is supposed to be way better, but we'll just have to wait and see. Once that shit's in control, then by all means, blame the shit out of Tesla for each wreck that approaches the average rate of car crashes for good drivers. Edit: This happened a while ago, so some of the safety features I mentioned may not have been implemented, but they have always made it very clear that you need to be awake, alert, and ready to take over at any time. After a very small amount of driving it's very obvious by the car's driving style, that it shouldn't be fully trusted. It generally stays in the lines, but it's not smooth, and the fact that it's not smooth, reiterates the already very clear warnings that Tesla provides about needing to be vigilant at all times."
The smell
"That the person inside the car whom you're trying to save is either passed out, incapacitated, an infant, or a retard. Or that the car has been bent to shit. The inside door handles are mechanical."
"Think of everyone you know. How many of those people are mentally equipped to actually create new things? As an engineer you'll have engineer friends who can do this stuff, but think about ""normal people"". Most of them can barely tie their shoelaces and show up to work on time. These people can't compete with the current level of traditional automation, let alone the fancy shit that's becoming mainstream now. These are the people who used to work in the fields, but now can't because we've mechanized farming. They're the people who used to work in the coal mines, but now that work's done by a few skilled operators with a ton of machinery. They're the people who worked in factories, and were replaced by automated construction lines. They're the people who worked at petrol stations and airport check-ins and supermarket check-outs, and were replaced by self-service kiosks. They're the people who worked in warehouses, and were replaced by Amazon's warehouse robots. They're the people who work in Wal-Mart and McDonalds, and are being replaced by automated kitchens. They're the people who are running out of places to go."
Imagine having to fight these things off in a robot apocalypse...

Just sitting there and going around the same loop every ~30 minutes (guessing at speed here) over and over again. Edit just did the math on the time and distance they averaged 23.58 mph so a 16 mile loop would take 41 minutes"

Now this chain wouldn't have been possible if you hadn't gotten a salary, (the waitress would've just been raped and not been part of this story, part and parcel). However this entire series is recorded not just on a central Jew bank, which can decide to say that the mudslime didn't rob her. This entire chain of events is recorded on thousands of serves, and each time a transaction takes place each old transaction is checked. Now since multiple transactions take place in the world, we need a system to compute them and arrange them as a chain, which is where mining and problem solving come in place for security etc. However fundamentally as a user you just need to know that he blockchain is decentralised,can't be censored and you can attach multiple things on top, currency or social network or anything else."
Well if wages kept up with inflation it might have slowed this down or at least helped keep the economy going. But coming in and wanting to double wages (small businesses biggest expense) over night? That's just balls out retarded and going to destroy businesses like crazy.

"The EU has some kind of mental complex that that they think due to the size and how prominent they are Microsoft and Google should have to allow everyone the chance to compete fairly on their own platform despite it being pretty much common sense that as a business you always favor yourself. If you want to compete with an Alphabet company you should probably not try doing it on a platform that Alphabet controls, the EU however thinks that they should be able to have an even standing point. It is like expecting to be able to buy an HP computer from the Dell website, or even expecting them to give a comparison that is truly neutral of the other company on their own site they may not lie but it will always be biased. Making it even more absurd in my mind is that they expect Alphabet's free service will not favor the services that bring in money and allow them to offer that service for free."

Our government likes it that way so we all continue to suck military cocks and think we're invincible. Makes for a happy populace.  Russia likes it too. Easier for them to keep secrets.

Speed of light weapon capable of devastating damage and also of shooting missiles and other projectiles out of the sky.  You tell me.
Let's not. While handheld launcher (the most advanced AA weapon ISIS has) can't ever touch a F-22 something like a Russian S-400 is different. While there is almost no doubt that American air superiority would prevail eventually should a conflict in Syria involve those systems (if the Syrian Army is fought the best they have are S-300) that shit WILL cost American lives. Not a single conflict since WW2 has seen the involvement of modern anti air weapons and I'd honestly like to keep it that way.

No ammunition. Fires in a straight line rather than an arc. Invisible and soundless. Travels at the speed of light.
Not so much pollution as it is living in a desert shit hole.
There is now a new weapon system known as a drone swarm - you can get swarmed with 500 small weaponized drones all at jet speed - impossible to intercept them all - except perhaps with a rapid fire laser system that needs no ammo. The laser will probably evolve into one of the best weapons ever - so the Pentagon definitely wants to get there first.
"There's a lot of ways in which you can improve laser ""penetration"", and even if you don't, so what? The weapon, much like every other weapon out there, has limitations. Training and planning will take those into account when deploying gunships equipped with it and that's that. It still doesn't beat the fact they now have a weapon that fires at the speed of light, produces no recoil and has no dropoff."

Edit:  Here's a NASA paper on the topic:  https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050192479.pdf.

"Meh... I doubt he has that much pull in the Supreme Court. More like the supreme court defending business interests bfr all. Since :   The case stems from claims by Equustek Solutions Inc, a small technology company in British Columbia that manufactures network devices, that distributor Datalink Technologies Gateways relabeled one of its products and sold it as its own online and acquired trade secrets to design and manufacture a competing product.  And their main argument being :   The global reach was necessary, according to the court, because if the removed search results were restricted to Canada alone, purchasers both in and out of Canada could easily continue to find and buy from Datalink.  The lawsuit against Datalink should take care of lost sales anyways, if succesful. It's all bullshit."
"According to  most of these countries, that simply isn't good enough.

"The problem is that this sort of thing is being used to slowly push more and more control on people.  While you may not be directly impacted, you're going to have to give up more and more technology to avoid this, and have to buy used, older units to repair or replace existing stuff.  Plus you don't have to be directly impacted, indirect results may get you as well, such as if Hollywood control schemes are used for censorship that dramatically alters elections. This helps to establish both the technology, and more important, the legal framework, for this approach, particularly by gradually introducing it and getting people used to it.  One rather macabre example seems to lie in the way control over PCs is slowly being ripped away from users with things like Windows 10."

"NASA currently says that we do not have the technology to do it again. For America it is ""diversity"" that is holding us back and preventing us from being able to make the trip, I don't know why there would be much of an issue for Japan. Maybe they don't have the infrastructure, like a command center, trained Japanese astronauts, ect."
"Tech isn't some catch-all stat. Rocketry is an extremely specialized technology, and one that was practically forgotten. In the 60s 4% of the US budget was dedicated to NASA and that was almost entirely focused on getting to the moon. But once we won the space race, all government funding for space was dramatically cut. For comparison NASA now gets less than half of one percent of the budgeting, and that half percent is split among a half dozen different mandatory programs. As there was no immediate money in space after we landed on the moon, capitalism meant it was a dead industry without government support. And so it remained for decades. Technology does not just magically move forward. Without people pushing it forward it can, and does, regress. We absolutely moved backwards from where we were in the 60s. It's possible that without SpaceX practically unilaterally rebooting the space industry that today we'd still be regressing."

"Maybe because America in the 60s had a huge cold war ICBM program that they wanted to fund, and one day someone said ""these stupid rockets are useless for anything other than to nuke the USSR... wtf are we gonna use them for, to go to the moon?"" and everyone said ""bob! you're a genius!"" Meanwhile Japan has had no military rocketry R&D going on and they have zero space industry. So yeah, from nothing to a moon rocket in 13 years isn't bad. I mean, SpaceX has taken longer than that to get to the point where they're looking at sending a lunar orbiter."

"No, they see their population as cogs to be ground up and spat out by working them to death from school to retirement, assuming they live that long (and if they don't, 'worked to death' goes from hyperbole to literal; a lot of people die from overwork-related illnesses and/or offing themselves from the same). One of the reasons that stuff like this is cropping up is because a lot of people have given up on their establishment work-to-death system, and with it prospects of marriage and children.  There are other issues, seeing as how their 'herbivore male' situation, as they call it, is a bit more complicated of a beast IIRC, but this is definitely one of the major factors.  That said, all things considered, it's questionable just how much you're missing out on, considering if you're working from 8 AM until 11 PM (or later) 6 days a week and possibly even sleeping in a capsule hotel a lot of the time, it's not like you're going to be seeing your wife and kids much.  Assuming the kids aren't being worked to death in cram school themselves, which they almost certainly are."

I've stopped asking...just drink.
"Kodi is a program that runs on most operating systems. It provides a GUI similar to your DVR or smart TV. It can and will run legitimate services like Amazon, Netflix, etc. via addons.... but that is not it's appeal. There are hundreds of addons for Kodi that provide an inexhaustible supply of content. Some of it is completely legitimate... like the PBS addon. Other addons enter a grey area. There are addon packages that install other addons and change the interface, making the entire program much more complicated but multiply the available content exponentially.  The two most popular are ‚ÄúPulse‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Beast.‚Äù These packages are both somewhat Euro-centric but if you are into soccer, cricket or foreign language programs you are in luck. There are live channels that directly stream all the cable and   satellite feeds.  When I first got mine we used the college football playoffs and then the Superbowl as tests to see if it was a valid replacement for cable. We got all the games in standard def and a few in high def. When watching the Superbowl we had a lagging stream and switched to the next source on the list which turned out to be in spanish and was a lot better than listening to the usual talking heads. They get way more excited.  So, why should you care?   Well, the cable/ satellite  companies' reaction to the cord cutting trend has been to increase prices. So odds are, you are paying about $120 a month for 1000 channels of shit.  Part of that payment goes to support really shitty entities like CNN or OWN (Opra Winfrey Network.) You can probably name a few more channels you would rather not support.  They have resisted all efforts to give people what they want at a reasonable price, and don't really have any incentive to clean up their act. They hate their customers, vendors and each other. I worked for one of the big ones which recently changed its name to something that rhymes with ‚ÄúRectum.‚Äù  I watched one guy waste several million dollars to embarrass the guy in the next office over. I watched them fire 75% of management to make it easier to sell the company... you should be asking how they could afford to ditch that much management and the answer is: 75% did nothing but play golf and collect a 6 figure paycheck. To summarize, the industry is made up of a bunch of scum sucking ass-hats that have used every illegitimate means to keep from changing.  In other countries, the system is different but equally fucked.    The movement in using SBC's and open source software to provide a distribution channel is hugely disruptive tech and is growing like mad. With no central party to sue or throw in jail, the industry is responding by attacking net neutrality in the US and by getting the media to write false stories about the technology.  It will not mean the death of most actual content providers like HBO or AMC, but threatens the parasitic ones like home shopping, propaganda and religious channels.  Many people just buy a box or stick from someone who has configured it. If you wanted to do it on your own you can take a single board computer like a raspberry pi ($35.)  Plug in the HDMI cable ($1,) a 2amp usb wall charger and a cheap USB mouse ($1.)   Install Openelec OS (free) on a 8gb Micro SD card ($5.) For this you will need something that can write to a micro SD card. You can get a USB hub with one for  $10 or a USB card reader/ writer for $2. Install the Pulse CCM or Beast addon. There are a ton of howtos and videos on how to do all this. Just remember, when you install the addon, it may ask for an email address, just enter a fake one and it will let you proceed.  I have personally had a much better experience using the non-raspberry SBCs and remix/android OSs.  These have a taskbar and back button for times when Kodi starts acting up.  Another tip I can pass on is the ‚Äúlong click‚Äù which is similar to the ‚Äúright click‚Äù in other OSs. Also keep in mind that this is a bleeding edge thing so you can expect   2007  a learning curve on using it as well as a few bugs along the way. tl;dr ‚Äì This is a disruptive technology that is most damaging to companies that treat their customers poorly."

You should care because with an HTPC and free software such as Kodi (but also with dedication and time because you have to acquire all your media), you can browse your entire media collection, as well as a handful of online content on your screen in a format that was designed for viewing from a distance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_mU8JSk5dU I've been using it for many years, mostly because I absolutely CAN'T STAND the way it feels navigating my media through windows explorer or the file browser.  This way it feels as though I am on a console or a special device that was made for my content, even better with a PC remote I can navigate everything just like tv.  To make things even better, with the PsuedoTV Live addon you can take things such as folders, youtube channels, podcasts etc and assign them to channels (1 - 900) you can watch and surf through just like broadcast television. This takes more effort than netfux though, since you need to download everything yourself."
"I computer, in some ways, is like an extension of your mind. And no government has any right to control that."
"Was your phone nearby? Also, are you M/F? And don't give me any of that inbetween bullshit."
"There are already plenty of routers between you and your destination with standard internet,       That forward your ip address all along the way as part of your traffic to your requested site.  TOR doesn't do that, it strips all of the normal identifying information from your traffic and encrypts it so that the only ip address the site you're contacting sees is that of the TOR exit node, and the node doesn't have your original address either, only the address of the preceding node hop through the network.  That's why anyone wanting to snoop on it has to expend quite  a bit of resources in order to have a very large number of TOR relays temporarily under their control, so that they can use specialized traffic monitoring algorithms on them to track encrypted traffic. It's hit or miss and it can't go on for long at a time because it eventually gets noticed. Their best results at busting criminal TOR users has been in busting hidden services through the actions of their administrators and hosts in meat space and then hijacking the criminal hidden services themselves and feeding trace programs back to the users through the webpages accessed. The trace calls home from the affected machine after it accesses the site through non-TOR standard internet and reveals the users ip address."
Pretty sure the government wants them on Windows though...
"Somebody sure is sour. AMD is actually giving Intel a run for their money forcing them to provide consumer end CPUs with more than 4 cores and keeps their pricing in check.  Intel have stagnated the past 8 years only offering marginal advancements and abandoning the tick/tock release cycle.  If Ryzen had not come out, we would still be rocking quadcores for another 10 years. Epyc fab was revolutionary. Instead of fabbing a whole 32 core die, they stitch four 8 core dies into one which brings up yields, lower costs and ultimately lowers prices. IDK how you can be against lower prices & better products unless you work for Intel"
"political speech, commercial exchange, collaborative programming, image boards, and sidestepping national level firewalls"
Can you EIL5 why Linux is better than Windows?
ohh yes.. I know but try to undurstand what i want to say.. ignore my engslish knowlege
I love that
Only the Democrats have to be concerned.
"Don't forget they don't pay for programmers like they used to.  Underpaid and overstressed does not make for the good output (plus too many meetings, meetings get soo far in the way)."
"In what way was it damn-near destroyed? Kaspersky Non-Security‚Ñ¢ works on all of the systems I had shat it onto. Their ""performance"" afterward depended entirely on hardware age and/or laptop vs. desktop."
"You should note something about win10: M$ already set a date for when they will stop updating/supporting it. Think about that and their ""last version ever"" marketing shit they've said."
"I don't use it at anywhere near that scale, I'm just waiting for webfaction to support automatic renewals. But I now realize that they probably have to deal with this. Thanks for the ping."
"And this is also spam. Buy a Voat ad ... otherwise, advertise your stuff somewhere else. Voat Ad Info)"
"'The actual prices of the stocks were not affected and no trades were completed at that price, a Nasdaq spokesman confirmed. '   So either a real glitch, or a trial run. Or a hacker put a decimal point in the wrong place."
"Thanks for the tip! I have one question though:   If there's red text showing a failure, turn off the machine and pull one stick. Reboot to memtest. Replace the stick and retest.  I don't really understand. What do you mean ""Replace the stick and retest""?"
With AGILE you test in production!
It's the first step towards a tiered internet. It's no big deal to the likes of Google and FB to pay Cox and others to speed up their sites; but smaller sites could not afford it and will wither.
"There's a million freeware tools you can track this on Windows. I used to use a program called DU Meter, back in XP days."
"Your router should have an option to track your data usage on a monthly basis. If it isn't already enabled, you can enable it through the administrator panel, but they usually hide it in the advanced settings. If you have a Netgear router, you can go to the Advanced tab, then ""Advanced Setup"", and then ""Traffic Meter"" and check ""Enable Traffic Meter"", which will log to a table at the bottom of the page your usage statistics for the current day, previous day, week to date, month to date, and previous month. As an added advantage over the suggestion /u/FuckBitchesGetMaga made is that your router will track across any and all devices connecting to the internet through it, whereas a freeware tool on Windows will only be able to track usage for that single device."
What about in 5 years when you want to stream VR or 4K content and you're going over that 5X in a month. Also probably like Comcast there way more expensive business internet has no caps.
I'm straight looking at becoming a WISP and dropping fiber to my home.  I'll be the WISP just to offset the cost of trunked fiber.
"For consumers, not for the providers themselves. Who create this magical data barrier out of their fucking asses."
"Dial-up internet usage was billed in hours. When DSL and cable came along, their big selling point was that they were always available, so a flat fee became the norm. Now they're trying to retreat from that ""mistake"" so they can gouge their customers for even more profit."
"Cox has a had a data usage meter for years. Log into your account with cox.net. On the upper right you will see ""Welcome JackNHoff"" with a drop down arrow. I think it's third row from the left fourth option( Not at home ATM to verify for sure) is Data Usage meter below internet tools. It will show what percent of your data you have used so far but if you click current or past daily use it will show a graph displaying how many GB for each day you used."
"You have the time and resources to use 1 TB of data, I envy you."
"Yeah, that point was conveniently left out of the article."
Oligopoly or just a glorified monopoly?
"so, stop building natural gas power plants, especially since the cost of solar is going down? And large storage sites filled with batteries could do the job at night."
"Comcast (xfinity) does this as well. As soon as you go over 1TB (Which, technically speaking, is a drop in the bucket) they start charging you overage fees for every 10GB you go past that. I think it's an attempt to slow those of us who haven't already cut the cord, and to punish those of us who have. Because when you start streaming all the media you normally would have watched over one of their cable lines, and have access far exceeding what is available in even their most expensive cable packages for the price of the service and the cost of the ISP subscription, you can see how its an opportunity for greedy men to exert more control and make sure they can suck up every last shekel from us goyim."
I hope so bad this happens
LOL! A fast weeaboo neck beard? Go drink acid. I hope your boss finds out... Oh wait. You spend your days on voat whining and bitching. Isreal wont open its borders
"To be honest, I'm quite surprised that there hasn't been crazies with sniper rifles going after all the fucks on TV"
"Then you're just proving their need to doxx meme creators even more; because ""obviously there are violent racists among them."" Join the moderates who just want them to apologize for what they did, see it as the terrible affront to privacy that it is, and purge the libtards from their ranks."
"This is the asshole that said little girls need to get use to seeing naked men in the restroom... Otherwise.. ""hate crime!"" ... F'ck! these assholes!  We can't wait until the civil war goes hot.. In the midst of all the chaos, we're gonna burn all these f'kers to the ground.. along with their friends and family..  It's gonna be f'kin glorious!"
How so ?
"LOL - you do have a point. I wonder how much drain there would be, a good question. And as an old geezer myself, I concur ... damn kids!"
"'They're' always listening. Kinda a Tesla free energy thing maybe. But @DiscontentedMajority had a good point, too. You're actually 'stealin' energy from something else, so who knows how this would effect other devices, should it become a widespread deal."
"I wouldn't think so.  Unless they were in-between you and the tower.  Also, I'm not positive it uses solely cell tower radio waves and not AM/FM waves too.  There's also emergency frequencies, HAM radios, CBs too.  I don't know what frequency it's using to charge, but microwave towers could charge it too."

"No one likes a bully, and with this little stunt they have made some powerful enemies. If they keep it up they would be wise to watch their back, what goes around comes around."
"I am not defending the fuckhead but bringing his family into it is a bit much. Even if the most talked about reddit user today was a kid, you can't make the other guy's family feel in fear for their lives, even though the statement from cnn or wherever said the user said they were. Would that be enough to get hanassholesolo into a protection program?  Edit: Wait wasn't cnn blasting emperor Trump's family anyway? All's fair in lies and deceit."
"Yup, nothing new."
"It's a click bait article, move along."
That's a good point.
Uh are you buggin on this one?
"Even if people were lazier, productivity could still go up."
Go check places like Torrentfreak for reports on reliable privacy services. I think PIA is currently the top choice. I wouldn't jump on any new start-ups until the more paranoid end of the online community has looked them over thoroughly.
The site has been put in for a ban as well
Until we can get other robots to repair.
"Quantum entanglement has no signal to intercept, the only way to hack this form of communication would be physical access to the transmitter or receiver."
"It is a pity that those terrorists are the ones I'm least concerned about, few suicide bombers are a threat after they have made the news. Prevention will always be better then blame in acts of terrorism."
that will be interesting inside of Office 365 you would have to fake traffic to their servers
Or finger guns.
"Further, the fact this became a W3C standard is outright appalling. This means a collective group of technologies endorsed creating a standard which evidences tampering of copyrighted material for the usage of legal prosecution.  W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee had concluded that the objections raised ""had already been addressed"" or that they were ""overruled.""  Berners-Lee literally invented the internet. His endorsement is either: valid, or; he's been paid-off. I am very on the fence as to which it is.  We [the EFF] disagree.  Read their mission statement. The EFF, the last frontier of digital rights protections, is calling bullshit on making these new copyright specifications a standard for browsers to implement.  Brave  I would suggest considering this as a default browser. Remember the Brendan Eich controversy (CEO outed from Mozilla by SJWs)? He invented Brave and disagrees with browsers implementing a standard that essentially documents users with a crime if they manipulate copyrighted footage. I would not suggest using any browsers which abide by the W3C endorsement of DRM, which will be all the mainstream ones."
"This is better than my evaluation, I think the main nuance I had is that it also allows [and encourages] browsers to document tampering of copyrighted materials, if one attempts to do so. Also, it is a threat on open source software. If the decryption algorithm is not made available to the public, then the concept of open source browsers is heavily reduced. If the decryption algorithm is public, then it re-inforces that reverse engineering it is a legal offense. I'm curious if you have thoughts on that, will Chromium or Firefox make this algorithm public?"
"DRM is better described as: Digital Restrictions Management (aka, the copyrights holders get to set the rules on how YOU view shit YOU paid for). People wonder why I am against Steam(ing piece of shit). You paid for stuff on there and yet you need to log in to use it (offline mode is this very small we let you because we can choose not to at any time shit people think is good). And as he said, circumventing it (for the USA) will land you in hot water (even for personal backup reasons, court cases and fair use are leaning towards fuck the public and public domain). Read: Circumventing their DRM is actually a FELONY offense. One they can sue you for ""lost income"" and criminally prosecute you (federal pound my ass prison) as an example should they catch you in the same courtroom."
