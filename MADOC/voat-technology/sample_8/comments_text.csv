Mega corps and government fully controlling peoples' transportation is not desirable, it's for pathetic slaves. The chilling effect on freedom of association would be huge, the corruption, and political targeting that could occur."
"I see the run red light at full speed around here a lot. Autonomous cars would be awesome if they get to the point they're generally required to not allow human control without tripping some sort of emergency mode thing that gets recorded so it can be confirmed it was an actual fucking emergency instead of I WANT TO RUN RED LIGHTS TO SAVE 2 MINUTES. As for fucking with signs, that definitely screws up humans more than a machine (I hate word CAPTCHA for that reason). Especially humans who do not normally travel through that area. It's just dumb since it will cause problems (this is why there are penalties for being caught fucking with traffic signs, sadly I don't remember how harsh they are)."
"Yea, this technology is the deciding factor in carjackings. I don't even know why the word carjacking exists considering this technology isn't out yet, and carjackings don't happen."

"As to how often I check the sides, always and every time. Hell I keep an eye on side roads with stop signs when I don't have any sort of stop or caution sign. If a car is coming up to the intersection I always ask ""are they stopping?"" But this is a habit I have developed due to being a motorcyclist, you have to be aware as people cut you off all the time and regardless of right of way you will be the one getting treated by medical personal while they will just have an insurance claim."
"Youtube is not a government entity  True. But they are de facto monopoly and work hand-in-hand with other SJW businesses and MSM, effectively forming a shadow government."
"Until they get into bed with big government then you can be arrested for what you 'like', upvote or watch online .. Islamabad has asked Facebook and Twitter to help it identify Pakistanis suspected of blasphemy so that it can prosecute them or pursue their extradition.

"Yeah, this isn't just willy nilly shooting down drones.  Best to stay away from the bases."
"Pushing people into ""alternative"" echo chambers is probably the intent.  Without a shared place to discuss ideas and refine common values, society faces civil strife and further divisions.  What is needed is a common forum where there is no censorship, but the curent platforms and forums are being distroyed in favor of one set of values/narratives at the expense of reason.  Those who want to have a rational discussion will find alternatives, but the result is still division divisiveness."
Another caution on this.  If you are going from 110 VAC to 220 VAC you do not want to use a surge arrestor strip.  The protection elements will start conducting at 220 VAC and you could see quite a bit of smoke come out of the strip.
"An HMD and smartphone aren't similar at all.  With an HMD floating screens can be any size you want, you can have dozens and thanks to satellite positioning they can be fixed so you could set up a playlist of videos for specific locations to give it a theme.  Most of you probably aren't old enough to know about drive-in movie theaters, those things were pretty awesome I got to experience it a few times when I was really young, with HMDs you can drive to a scenic location, set up a soundbar and recreate the drive-in experience. With smartphones you have a tiny 6 inch screen you have to carry, it's a pretty awful experience.   I'm just skipping out on smartphones mostly, waiting for the VR/AR era to fully commence."
"Are you going to wallow in your own shit while everyone else moves on, eventually fully virtualizing themselves and possibly leaving behind this existence for good. I can't wait to see all the idiot ""hipster"" threads in 10 years of people trying to seem cool for spending their time without an HMD or any electronic stimuli."

"Well - considering most of the people 'criticizing' this manifesto are braindead lefties - I would say it was lost before they even tried to read it. https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/so-about-this-googlers-manifesto-1e3773ed1788 Take this dumbfuck for example.  So it seems that someone has seen fit to publish an internal manifesto about gender and our “ideological echo chamber.” I think it’s important that we make a couple of points clear.  Okay, shoot.  (1) Despite speaking very authoritatively, the author does not appear to understand gender.  You mean despite providing credible and reputable sources for his claims?  (2) Perhaps more interestingly, the author does not appear to understand engin  3fea  eering.  Which has exactly how much to do with identity politics?  (3) And most seriously, the author does not appear to understand the consequences of what he wrote, either for others or himself.  Oh - hurt feelings, the most dreaded result of someone reading something they disagree with.  1.I’m not going to spend any length of time on (1); if anyone wishes to provide details as to how nearly every statement about gender in that entire document is actively incorrect,¹ and flies directly in the face of all research done in the field for decades, they should go for it. But I am neither a biologist, a psychologist, nor a sociologist, so I’ll leave that to someone else.  ANNNND THERE IT IS"

"More important, it wrecks the quality of ad data.  Data poisoning is the game here, not pure money.  If even a small percentage of data they get from tracking, ads, etc, is false, it fucks up their ability to use it to make real money.  Block some data trafficking, and lie to the rest of it.  Very effective."
"You can, but there are plenty of ways to filter out this kind of mass bot approach.  Google has large resources devoted to preventing this because it's mostly used by blackhats trying to make a buck.  AdNauseam type approaches work best because actual users are generating the data - they can't tell that it's crap."
It doesn't make them money over time.  It reduces the quality of their product and thus their return on it.  People who pay $400 per click don't want a bunch of garbage getting through.

"Then again there are have been multiple PUDS build their own service only to have cable lobbyists cause the state level to back out.  I would agree that for rural areas mobile is the most cost conceivable option. However I could also see mobile companies gerrymander their networks. Right ""currently data is retardedly expensive,"" more expensive cost will lower demand, coupled with a lower population density in rural areas; companies won't make the money to pay for the infrastructure.  In the mean time the mobile companies setup in the cities, provide the majority of the population with in a county a product and be stamped as OK. From a business standpoint, it makes perfect sense. From a citizen viewpoint, where location matters,  given areas will continue to have issues. Thus, nothing is solved, in my opinion. And granted, no answers, but I'd like to see a mechanism of reducing infrastructure costs, between customers and business-pool of providers. Doesn't matter if Ars is liberal circle jerk voat is conservative circle jerk. News is news, filter the relevant and irrelevant data."

"Um, no. We already paid multiple times for our telecomms/cable companies to build out to rural areas. One most definitely charges a tax every bill that goes towards said fund. As zug mentioned in a reply they just ignore building stuff and sue a city if they try to build their own network (then there's the states where they bought laws to make it flat out illegal for cities to make their own network). All of this shit is artificially induced to maintain a monopoly and just ride out on any infrastructure already made while charging more for it long after it's been paid for (mind you, tax payers foot the bill in the first place in a lot of cases). The industry is mostly rent-seekers."

In addition some managers can use a second factor to secure the account. Like a 2fa code in last pass or a key file in keepass. Using either of those would greatly increase security.
You could bioengineer viruses that irradicate other diseases. Or one that irradicates humanity. So its important that the right people invent it first.

"Also, Keepass (and I assume others) lets you do ""rounds"" of encryption. The function of this is so that each attempt at decryption actually involves several thousand rounds of decryption, thereby making each attempt take 1 second, 5 seconds, whatever you can stomach on your hardware."
"I didn't see an indication that they had broken anything at all... The KDBX file is an encrypted file. I'm glad it isn't stored in the app's own internal storage, because it means I can sync it with whatever technology I choose. Leaving out of the app storage isn't supposed to matter because the file is well-encrypted."
To control the flow of data of course.  Too much info is being sent and received for them to handle and stop.
keepass2android looks like possibly a good alternative on Android. I really like the idea of the app adding a pseudo-keyboard to avoid clipboard transfer. The QuickUnlock feature sounds like a bad idea though.
"Several reasons: first to lower the standards the ISPs have to follow and since the technology is consistently improving, also to avoid having to modernize current infrastructure since it's ""good enough"".  On the other hand you can also reduce the capabilities of simple individuals to offer commercial applications using their home connection; say, proxys, VPNs, hosting, etc. Arguably this can also slowdown the development of highly distributed networks that could revolutionize once again the internet and hit hard some of today's giants. (Government's won't like it too... )"

Part of that is the photolithography tools couldn't make light with a small enough wavelength to make further size reductions economically feasable. That led to a stagnation in size reduction.  Now there is a tool that makes 13nm light. Previous tools could only do 193nm at best.

Apple's software is restrictive, but Microsoft is doing the same thing these days, Apple does censor its App Store but you don't get scammed the way you do in the Google Play Store, and Apple's products have a longer lifespan under planned obsolescence (My pre-2000 Macs still work, albeit slowly) My 5+ year old iPad works fine.

"Get used to it, this is how virtually every CPU and GPU is going to be done very soon. Its an extremely cost effective method to build incredibly complex systems and its how AMD has done their APU systems for a long time now.  Its what Intel did in the past to get dual core Pentium 4's and later Core2Quads and used to do it with their Celeron, Pentium, and Atom chips that used PowerVR GPU's. Nvidia and AMD are pointing towards this being the future of GPU design with a kind of under the hood SLI / crossfire system that allows both companies to build a lot of smaller parts and literally glue them together to make a big GPU instead of relying on QA binning of big expensive parts to recoup the cost of making bigger and bigger die size GPU's."

"Blame   4f8  it on the SJW  Oh, I do. I knew who my enemies are after the whole Brendan Eich fiasco."
Modern hardware is amazing.  When I was a kid I wanted a PC with 4MB of RAM. Imagine if I had to tell younger-me that I could have all the RAM in the world but it would all go to waste due to everybody fucking everything over. Every time I see a functioning quad-core cellphone on the trash I feel like crying.
"Comments like yours make me realize at least it's not just me. At some point of trying many different software stacks for different needs I was wondering if it was me instead of the tools. Well, at least I'm not alone."
"We have industries where programmers get paid more for writing more lines of code.  Is this a figure of speech or is it an actual metric? If it's literal, it explains quite a lot."
"100% agree There really needs to be a separate world of computing (as in, any Turing-complete device) where people who need quality and standardization and normies don't bump among each other. That world will take decades to complete though. How is nobody asking for security cameras with OSS firmware and drivers? Are you (we) really that stupid to ""trust"" the company doesn't slip in some malware of some sort?"

Us cis white patriarchal devils are the ones picking up the slack and not getti  1006  ng the recognition we deserve simply because on a conference call it would look like the company is racist if a white guy got praise when he clearly does better. Just like Google employees taking off the day after the  memo was written, who were all the people at the office picking up the slack? Right. White  nationalists, lol."
Xer priorities are on point. Gotta have a spyware running at all abstraction levels! Otherwise how can xer ensure you're not engaging in Wrong Think?

"As someone not that into this world, care to explain why you guessed correctly?"
I've never actually seen it first hand. I had net negative line count scores and was never reprimanded for that.
"Python is quite a capable language. Dependencies aren't perfect and pip is a little yucky. But it really is straight forward. And it's easy to read once written, unlike Perl, Ruby, and a bunch of other languages."
Not that I disagree but that ship has sailed. You just can't make everything be difficult back again. You're gonna have to deal with illiterates sending emojis to their nephews. That's your userbase now and you better cater to them (or else!). The same applies at different levels to any sphere. You gotta deal with programmers that don't understand the concept of byte and bit.
"Skimmed through it. I try not to get addicted to drama (that's what drama queens say, I know). Same thing with Gamergate: I know it was a thing with feminists but I don't wanna really get into it. Too much shit going on in my own country to focus on that."
"Unless we come up with some voodoo shit it looks like the amazing hardware advances we had for the last 20 years might be slowing down, forcing programmers to use resources more efficiently. This should hopefully incentive good coding practices."
It's not like millions of lives depend on your code being good enough! I heard the only programmers with an engineering-like level of thoroughness are embedded-software ones but seeing Chinese hardware makes me disagree with that.
THANK YOU! Gonna give it a try!
"Not saying that stuff doesn't exist, just that I don't directly deal with it. Every time I see a new Apache piece of software I'm amazed but I never have to use any of it, so it's nothing more than a nerdy interest. Not a programmer, just wanted to script some shit easily."
"Which one? The one for the platform I just installed or the one for the library I actually need? Cause I read both but there's no unifying library-platform manual, I get an FAQ and some random posts about it. You make it seem I'm a man page away from my answer. Well, maybe I am but I don't know WHICH one."
Maybe it's a millennial-nihilist kind of thing? Learning all these incompatibilities and workarounds make me momentarily forget I wanted to kill myself.

I managed to run Scrapy. The thing now is I don't know why tkinter is not recognized. Do I need to set the PATH environment to some folder or what? This was with Anaconda. So what now? Should I uninstall the shit I have installed and try with yours? Another goat also suggested it.  stop trying to develop in Windows  Not gonna happen for the time being.
I'm gonna check the possibility of running this code on a Linux machine but I'm dealing with a Windows-only scenario as of now.

"You don't need to reinvent the wheel. Let's say you make a package.  That package has dependencies.  The way to deal with that is to pull in the code and release it with the package.  Keep package dependency levels at 1 layer deep.  But, lawyers get in the way of this."
Web-based applications/software as a service are great for compatibility (one piece of software works for every possible device and operating system rather than having to recode it several times) and companies probably like it because it's piracy-proof with a lot of room for upselling.

"I think Python is an excellent language, but no you won't be doing real-time motion tracking from video streams because it's slow as hell.  However, how often do people try to write high performance code in a scripting language?  Hopefully never. What could be better for a newb that wants to get things done quickly rather than spend 2 years getting a solid foundation with C and assembler?  Python has to be one of the best choices."
"So men are better coders than women, just like they're better chess players and better mathematicians."
"Fuck insane dependency chains that require you to have multiple copies of the same stupid fucking library in your application so that other libraries that depend on those libraries won't break.  Well what is the other option? You either have system-wide libs, and then you can't run hot new applications, for year-years (Debian) since stucked on old libraries, or some programs package own libs and therefore you can simply just fucking use them. Any other solution?"
"As a Javascript dev I've experienced this for around 7 years straight. JS technologies I've ended up learning and having to maintain the resulting work in roughly chronological order.  Plain JS/ES5 Protoype Dojo jQuery HTML & CSS Prepr  ffa  ocessors Canvas/SVG/Video/PDF Frameworks (e.g. D3/Mozilla PDF/Easel/Video and on and on) jQuery UI Backbone Knockout Coffeescript Grunt Bootstrap NodeJS (0.x-7.x) NPM, Bower Angular 1 Gulp CSS Postprocessors Cordova Material Design ES6 Meteor JS Webpack Angular 2 (/4) Typescript Serverless & AWS (huge black hole, prob a dozen technologies with heavy docs)  This is a portion of the JS turnover I've seen. Not even counting accessibility, internationalization, backend research when you need to change APIs, command line learning, SSH. I guess that's why they pay so well now ;-) I'm not complaining, but fuck I get burnt out like 3 times a year."
Did you miss the node.js controversy?   lol which one? There's a few
Next year's gonna be great at Google Hug-Jam.
I find that to be the hardest part of attempting to pick up anything new.  It almost seems like this is on purpose. They don't want anyone actually learning how to work this stuff.
"Not to mention this fucking push of python everything and use the browser in place of an actual control panel or dashboard in the FOSS community. Yes because that's how you build up the damn user base, make the software almost impossible to use, update, & add new features too.

elementary school teaching.  I think I would make an excellent teacher. But I'd be too terrified of being accused of something for being a male teacher. And I make way better money doing my regular job.
"I've been on both sides of the fence, QA and developer. IMO, if the developers are doing a good job, QA is pretty easy. It's when devs get the ""good enough"" attitude and sling crap code around that things get ugly. Far too many devs I've worked with depend on QA to ensure the quality of the code, rather than writing quality code to begin with."
"In defense of developers: ""Good Enough"" essentially translates to ""developer burnout"" on the backend.  Reasons already mentioned in this thread: dozens of ""frameworks"" if you can call them that each likely being abandoned by their authors after only a year or two, or forced by coworkers or managers to comply with current year cargo-cult standards that too will die off in popularity by next year, and a myriad of other problems programmers regularly deal with."
"The main reason I've stuck with Firefox, even after they fired that CEO a few years ago, is because of the drop down menu on the address bar which has all your most visited sites.  I was recommended a chromium based browser with said drop down menu, but scrolling over certain embedded elements (eg Twitter, YouTube, Ingram ) on some forums makes it impossible to scroll with the mouse wheel.  Palemoon has no issues with scrolling and has the drop down menu. Will give it a go for a while and see how it goes."

"I can't say what, but I had to cold strap an OS.  It's not Linux, but some dead fag decided that .deb was the future. I wouldn't wish cold strapping on Debian shit on anyone but the faggots who insist Linux is viable.  What a collosal waste of time, and the best part is my bruitforce traditional build did the same shit and I was running 2 months before the debfags on the project.    These retards didn't understand that you actually need a functional cross compiler and it's shitty frameworks to actually build anything.  Then they try to pass off the magical build off as theirs, but I'd hidden shit in the exe's...  New format string...  I now see why Mark made all the MZ in MS-DOS. The stupid part is, nobody builds just a package, you are there to build an OS image, but now you can selfhost and check out, but thanks to the interdependancies a hello world will check out almost everything. But I gotta say so nice to see my kernel build run 1st"
"The problem arises when hardware changes.  And it always does.  Waste so much fucking time in optimizing some shit to run again.

"my experience is mixed.  runs great, runs like shit, and reinstalling the same version on the same machine seems to change the performance and issues.  Like it doesn't install the same each time?"
"Same can happen with Windows. Only difference is, if it happens with Linux, you have a recovery shell and live media to help you recover your OS. With Windows, the go to solution is usually. Better format and reinstall mate. Reformat is rarely the only way to fix a borked Linux system. 99% of the time, there is a way to fix it without a reinstall. But yes, both have issues."
There's issues with the Broadcom wifi card in this Dell laptop too.  Even getting it working in Windows is a PITA. Linux is not for people who are low on patience.
"I have issues every time I install Linux, the latest time I installed Mint I spent 2-3 hours troubleshooting the install. It ended up being that my video card's driver's weren't supported, because apparently a NVIDIA 960GTX wasn't mainstream enough for it to work right from the install. I had to go into a safe mode, and manually install the latest drivers or I'd just get a black screen with no explanation. The time before that there was issues getting the onboard LAN driver to work, I had to manually move the driver over on a USB stick from another machine. The same hardware had all just worked on Windows after the install. Part of it is that i'm not as familiar with Linux, it has gotten way easier to use than it used to be, but if I go to install Windows it just works. I cant remember the last time I've had an install or driver issue with Windows. I also game, so at least for my main box, there would be no way I'd be able to use Linux."

What you expect them to just use the article headline without sensationalizing it more then the media did?
"decentralized often means ""on other people's computers"" or is expensive due to redundant hardware. It may protect the content for the owner but the rest of the world will still need one location to go to www.thisismywebaddress.abc and that is the point that will fall under attack and make the rest useless to have multiple central points means you have multiple networks and multiple people running them and selling address so you may have voat.co that link here on one then on another voat.co that links to reddit and a third linking voat.co to some virus laden buy this address now squatter.  No one is going to correct changes to a site by the owner of that site, it is their site thus the changes are the correct ones. Just because you don't like the changes doesn't give anyone the right to rollback someone else's site. If it did they would just rollback your site they don't like to being ""This page under construction"" making you do it over and over."

"I love these kind of conversations. I will start by saying I love Ubuntu, however this is all horseshit. As much as I hate Microsoft with a passion :  Never had a single problem with any Windows version. Report home can be turned off. I have no anti-virus on and masturbates to some of the craziest shit. Have been for decades. Never paid a fuckin penny for any Windows, ever. PC boots in 5 seconds under Windows 10. This has to do with specs. Turns off in 5 seconds. April creator update still not on my PC. See 7. No update as ever restrained me in any way. Still furiously beating off to weird shit. Again, always had windows running like butter since 95. Bloatware if you install it. Human input. Microsoft has never told me how I should not torrent movies. I still do everything I want to do. Again, not ONE viral infection.  This always comes down to human input. Linux defenders are a lot like communism defenders. Won't shut up about it and never believes people saying they are having problems with the model. If you really believe that Mint is a sound solution for a person fucking it up on Windows, you need to find the heaviest door in your house, put your head in the open and go at it until you induce a coma.

"No it doesn't. This represents an increasingly more powerful cabal of politicized individuals who are deciding what should be allowed on the internet. A personal grudge should not constitute the right to silence arbitrarily. They should not set a precedence like this over political disagreements. If they were so butthurt over the endorsement, they should have stated that they have nothing to do with these people publicly while reaffirming their principles that support a free internet. At the very least they should have some internal review process that determines whether the individuals breached their terms of service beyond, ""We don't want to be associated with them, so we destroyed them."" I agree that it was probably unwise for DS to poke the bear, but it doesn't make what CF did right. Are they not fair game to criticize? Will they shut down every site where individuals who endorse opinions or ideas they disagree with express themselves? Are we next? It would be different if there were alternatives to their service, but there really isn't. This is the slippery slope in action..."
Destroy them -- thats what will happen as a reaction formation to their bullshit. Whiteys response to being out-gamed is fascism.  The socialists learned well but they are always one step behind. You think california is an open air prison now?  Wait until we bring back the internment camps. But instead of japanese it will be everyone on the left. They are pushing us towards fascism as a solution. Fucking idiots.
"Presently, we use Amazon's CloudFront for our CDN, delivering larger assets, images, videos, shit like that; with our site code handled by load balanced Apache servers. Kind of clunky, but it works for what we're doing."
Even Voat uses it.
Not exactly censorship in the conventional sense. they are not stopping the performers from performing or selling their music. They are merely withholding their services.

It's more helpful to call them ""Globalists"".  (((Jews are the original Globalists, if you think about it. Stateless masters of usury.))) But I don't want to end with that... I think this place should be a more focused community and the current dialect will never give the results purportedly desired by Voat's common denominator. It seemed that MAGA was making headway when we were just calling them Globalists! I feel like the elites are no longer the target.  CEO's are now left wing heroes, and swasticas are all the rage with conservative Americans.  Everyone is being used. Sorry for mudding up the place, I'm just bored.

No, seriously, this is the solution used before by some crackpot who put his life on the line to peddle his shit solution.

He died soon after (insane levels of lead poisoning directly through his lungs) and we spent around 50 years breathing leaded gasoline fumes. This solution took about 20 years of cleaning before it stopped altering human behavior into the less violent range. Fear not, there is 1 company still selling leaded gasoline and they only sell it to the Middle East."

"Like all internet shams, money from investors to keep it afloat. Then you get enough of a customer base and it turns into the ""it"" place to be on the internet.

They will pump the company until it goes public, sell off their holdings as soon as their is a whiff of down turn, and move to the next company."

they did the same with pedophiles and drug dealers. it's ok to have an opinion about that as an organisation but its not really their fault feeling obliged to openly distance themselves from users of their technology. nazis eat bread too but bakers are not expected to distance themselves from baking bread for nazis. the fact that the media/people expect them to do is because governments portray anonymity as something shady and borderline criminal and anonymizing services have to justify their right fro existence.

"yeah i would take this Zuckerman journalist and medium with a pinch of salt, most people who write about Japan don't get it or only start to get a tiny bit of bit and get spun out and side lined going in a completely wrong direction. However I have been around Asia and I will tell you Japan is sometimes weird, does things that would not be acceptable in the West as normal...vending machines selling beer open on the streets, also selling used school girl panties yes in vending machines, they have that whole constant school girl fetish thing and grocery stores and 711 can be seen selling all kind of flith and porn, or you might find a salary man reading anime tentacle porn manga on the subway...I'm not sure what caused all this maybe the Japanese were always perverted always henna 'otaku'. However I do know this Japan is simply a different culture, the Western American woman will often look like a beached whale once she hits 28 or very obesse beyond 30 while Japanese will often keep their age well into their 40s so they are perhaps more attracted by looks of 'youth' and another thing Japan like to fantasize, play, karaoke, dress up...not just for Comiccon but anytime and they hugely value their privacy, their message boards are ancient where you can say anything like 4Chan and Zuckerberg would be way too much of a gaijin control freak for them. Oh yeah and the elite or globalists or illuminati they also exist in Japan except they operate under a very Japanese way of doing things, they are called the 'Zaibatsu' some new blood and new families have challenged but the major tech companies, building builders, manufacturing groups, computer researchers and services they are mostly all 'Zaibatsu' connect.

I'd imagine there's a reasonable chance that we're actually looking at things play out in the opposite direction: parallel construction. That people were organizing on that site in order to break the law is hardly a secret. I would be extremely surprised if it was not under surveillance if for no other reason than to ensure that their planned lawlessness didn't go beyond petty rioting. The site was also likely filled with law enforcement plants. The latter part in particular could also explain why the warrant was broad and the affidavit behind it sealed. Revealing exactly what they know (as in exactly what names they're after) could reveal undercover agents and other knowledge that law enforcement would rather keep confidential for current and future investigations.

"The problem with this is that, chances are, the hardware will not be manufactured at sufficient scale to be very cheap, and when it initially comes out there will be no OS support for it.  So you'll be paying a very heavy premium for what will probably be inferior hardware (for lack of state-of-the-art production facilities) that does nothing and will do nothing for the foreseeable future.  This also doesn't include the customization that will end up happening to the OS to make it work well on a phone as opposed to a computer so it can do things like, we  ffa  ll, frankly, dial.  These are the kinds of things that need to happen so that people will actually buy enough to make the company remain solvent, because crowdfunding is likely only going to get you so far, even if it gets to the point where actual hardware is produced and sold. Mind you, this would be good, but I just don't see it happening, at least not any time soon.  It's presently a chicken-and-egg problem with anemic chickens and smaller-than-average eggs.  As hardware production gets more flexible there may be more options then, but that's probably a ways off at least. That said...  Let the KDE and GNOME guys worry about the UI. Because they are best at those things.  I think there are a very large number of Linux users who would dispute that assertion."

"Via the web client or the android/iOS apps.    I too am a little bummed with no support for third party mail apps but I can recognize the issue.  Protonmail is not just a email service (those are a dime a dozen).  What they are is a secure email service and guaranteeing security with a POP3 connection is practically impossible as you cannot guarantee the security of the e-mail once the client has copied it. You and I may not care and understand the risks of local storage but the average user probably doesn't. So Protonmail is trying to keep it simple and don't support the option. That said, they have claimed to be working on a IMAP solution.  In theory IMAP mail doesn't need a local copy buy in practice many apps will store a local cache of mails. Not sure how they handle that issue but from a post they made at the beginning of the year it sounds like their IMAP solution involves placing a self contained local IMAP server on your machine that handles the email storage (and communication with the protonmail server).   It was suppose to be available mid 2017 but I haven't heard an update about it recently (supposedly they had something in Beta in the spring).  Hopefully they come up with something but it sounds like it will only work on ""real"" computers that can run the local IMAP server.  It likely won't support third party clients on tablets or phones. Just a guess though."

"Not to mention gov't funded, non-military ventures are often watered-down compared to their privately funded counterparts."
"I'm having trouble understanding the nuances of the technology, but it sounds like the reason why POP3 and IMAP won't work is because neither protocol has a way to decrypt the mail they'd be receiving.  Remember that Protonmail only stores encrypted messages that are decrypted on your device, whether in the browser or mobile app.    Protonmail Bridge (unreleased) is supposed to provide a way to run a local relay on your PC that would decrypt mail locally and serve it via IMAP on your PC only; you'd connect your preferred IMAP client to that."
"Yes, but if you're using Gmail then Google has access to 100% of your messages instead of just the portion of messages you send to Gmail users.  And in any case, can't you still use Gnu Privacy Guard with Protonmail if you're cautious about the security of sending to Gmail accounts?"
Yeah. 2-300 is fine for a personal electric car but for trucking its worthless. I'd say at the very least 500 miles per charge

Everyone needs to find and agree on a decent existing piece of hardware then write a new software for it. From there a base can be built to make hardware more feasible. That's the best possible chance I think this idea has of succeeding.

"i have been advocating this forever. my motivation is to be able to use the torbrowser for non tor traffic too because most tracking doesnt happen by ip anyway but by fingerprinting, cookies and supercookies. and i think randomizing the fingerprint instead of giving every user the same one also solves many problems. there are many things to improve but it is not in their interest because they get undisclosed sums of money from secret partners to implement specific features so it works exactly as they desire."
has there been a case where this has not happened because of bad opsec?
that means u all need to start using private vpns. free or $ they need to be private. the degree of security/privacy each one will offer depends more or less but thats mainly a user thing of what he want or does.
"Okay, so I guess that now we, as true alt-right conservatives, are supposed to stand strong against online anonymity, and all other forms of pedophilia and child abuse? I demand close tracking of all online, and any other activity, from now on, for the sake of the children and to protect us from terrorism!!!!  Is that what you're looking for?"
I hope not. :(
"Tor is a shithole now heavily infiltrated by FBI and still a haven and shithole for drug pushers, guns for hire and human trafficking pedophiles...now they censor conservatives and the 'alt-right'...go figure"
"Yeah, I tried Tor a bit a few years ago buy felt too much like a Honey Pot. Anyway, most of us probably have some kind of anti anonymity worm."
"Tor, but better in a lot of ways, and you can (and are encouraged to) torrent over it. Which is nice; but it's a wasteland of early adopters, atm. So, the more people use it, the sooner it can take off."
"That is why it was so important to control""fake"" aka inconvenient news.  We'll never get any visibility on the censored network.  That is what it is now.  It's not open or free, it's now censored. The book burning has begun and I'm too scared to speak out."
ELI5 the difference between onion routing and garlic routing?
There are automated tools in Tor project that will detect and indeed blacklist such bad exit nodes.
"Yeah I wanted to get TOR a few years ago to see other conspiracy content that I probably ""wouldn't find on the open internet"" but I then decided against it because I thought it was fishy then later came across an article on reddit claiming the military set that up for ""military to use"" originally and then knew right away to stay the fuck away from it."
I'm the IT support guy at my current job. Many people are severely fucked when they lose their browser-saved passwords for any reason (such as their browser being uninstalled or a hardware failure).
Exit node domination is not enough to censor a hidden service on tor because exit nodes are not used for hidden services. This would require an exploit in the encrypting of the onions that give the onion router its name. The nodes don't know what each layer of the onion is and can't without a cryptographic exploit. Exit nodes know when you are using tor as a proxy to clearnet because this is unavoidable. NSA is not going to burn a crypto exploit to slow down the daily stormer.
"Yeah, taking this uncritically is a bad idea. There are attacks on hidden services all the time. It's not just him, and it's not just Tor, either. Free speech is under fire, if he hadn't noticed. That's why truly distributed systems like ZeroNet (which can work with Tor somehow, maybe I2P too?) and IPFS and so on."
"I remember a while back, maybe 4-5 years back, TOR was really slow. Basically unusable. And then almost overnight those problems disappeared. Those thousands of NSA nodes sure do help."
the thing that pisses me off the most about that is that i would mean that the US is actively allowing child porn and their exploitation. i've heard how they will set up sites to trap predators but the fact that raping children is more preferable than being conservative is insane
What about ARM CPUs?
"Hey, how much money would it take to host our own websites?"
"No, its just not as widely supported/used as TOR so its not as user friendly yet."
"Well, then don't come crying to me later then. :)"
"They can't stop the dailystormer. Their signaling about how much they want to, but are unable to, serves to further reinforce the benefits of TOR, which might be their plan. If Voat could think and stop being butt-hurt for a bit, people might stop panicking."
Tor and networks like it are important. I would argue that the right to privacy is more important than the right to free speech.
No disassemble!
"Yeah, wait a year or two until they release the next model, then the price should drop to a cool $950,000. Big savings."
"How though? We would start our own ISP just to host VOAT. When Icann gets involved we would move to P2P. You can't stop the message, only the medium."
I tried to avoid antisemitic stereotypes and actually looked at the bio of those women.
Exactly. It's more likely his site just got super popular and it having difficultly scaling up on Tor.
Go worry about fixing your fuckin country and not what we call refined crude oil.
"Wiped remotely? I believe that is very possible. When I used to listen to Alex Jones back in the day I remember him saying old technology was going to get useful and expensive because new tech will be able to be remotely controlled, shut down, wiped, etc."
They seem to not understand where to draw the system boundaries for the emissions or life cycle analysis.
Why did you buy electric?
Why did you buy it?
"In China they have government control. In the US we have corporate control, which is only minimally distinctive when nearly the entire Internet landscape is controlled by them."
Source that NSA owns the most of Tor nodes?
Right. The Department Of Transporation must be a criminal for providing the roads that drug dealers drive on. ISPs are guilty of crimes committed on their networks. Gun manufacturers are guilty of murder when their guns are used to kill. How far will you take this logic?
"It's Tor, not TOR. And who is Tor?"
I wasn't even aware of the jew narrative. What really happened?
Only in US? Several EU countries have been talking about this for years.
"The lengthy charge times are for using any conventional outlet. At charger stations you're at 50% in 20 minutes, 80% in 40 minutes and 100% not much longer after that - though batteries charge more slowly the the nearer to full they are. Electric vehicles will almost certainly replace long haul truckers due to automation. Drive for 4 hours, charge for 1 = 19.2 hours of peak performance driving per day for $0 in cost other than maintenance/charging. Not only can it travel vastly longer distances than a human and do it more safely, but it can also do it for a tiny fraction of the cost of a human. Driverless taxis will likely have a similarly revolutionary effect on personal transport. The thing I think many people don't understand is that driverless taxis have the potential to be a cheaper form of transportation than actually owning a vehicle. The driverless aspect means all that anything above the bare essentials to maintain and operate the car (which a personal driver must also pay) is profit. The big difference is economies of scale. Large fleets of autonomous taxis will be able to obtain great benefits on repair, maintenance, and general operation of their vehicles. And the lack of drivers also means upscaling is trivial. Most are thinking of driverless taxis as basically what we have now, but without a driver. In reality, this technology will likely completely reshape society as we know it."
"You're looking at 300 mile ranges on vehicles like a Tesla model 3. You could drive out there, run the entire route several times, and get back to civilization with 0 issues."
"Yeah, do you have any idea how long it takes to clone a hard drive?  Even with USB 3.0 speeds and multi-processing??? I remove your 120 GB SSD drive, I plug it into a 6 GB/s cable, and the best I get is about 200 mb/s.  That means it's gonna take about 15-30 minutes to copy.  And that's not verifying it to ensure it's a GOOD copy. Imaging a 120 GB drive live?  Shiiiiit...that's gonna be 30-60 minutes, because there's no way your computer is going to put all it's resources to the USB 3.0.  Even if you're running a super fast laptop, at best I'm gonna get 15-30 minutes.    In short: I'd rather you unlock you laptop and THEN take it away.  The USB device I plug in?  That's a ""mouse jiggler"", so it makes your computer think you're still using it and not lock out.  Then I can grab a nice memory capture and acquire the hard drive at a later time, without hassle of worrying if you're coming back. PS: don't leave your house with any computer you're doing illegal things on.  It's not healthy."
I'm waiting for it to show up on woot! before i take the plunge.
And all they did was create a black market for old korean people IDs. Same will happen in China.
You said it. If you can't plausibly deny with 100% monitoring then it's a risk too big to take.

Can't you get an external sim card apparatus
"iOS isn't based on linux, but on the XNU kernel like MacOS X;;  I think this phone is more for people who care about openness also. There are a lot of secure phones out there that are all locked up and secretive and can't be trusted in our minds. Hopefully, with the release of the hardware, the Purism phone will be open, secure, anonymous, and other words"
"It doesn't appear to be a matter of enemy versus friendly.  It is a matter of a company deciding to test its equipment by actually bombing someone (the fact Armenia and Israel are fairly friendly just makes it worse).  The Israeli company is claiming they didn't do it, that their customer (the Azerbijiani military) was operating it."
"Eh, if it works, it works."
"You can play some very simple games (but the PET wasn't very good for that), but no, there's no functional point. It's only to have a cool looking retro system sitting around. If you advance a few years you can have a Commodore 64 do some interesting things, like act as a simple Twitter client or play some games, and there is still value in teaching someone BASIC (it'd be a good toy for a technically inclined kid)."
thus the title...
"Dude, it says it right on the help section  About this Add-on This extension hides private and important metadata of your browser, usually obtainable using resource:// URIs, against the Web. You should have it installed if you use many extensions, because having many extensions means having many tracking and fingerprinting vectors. Also, Web sites can generally probe Firefox for installed extensions in many cases without this. The extension makes that privacy threat less effective. It may break some extensions which depend on this leak."
"It has the same point as restoring and preserving any other historical artifact has: To share the past (You know, our perspective on things.) with future generations.  An old computer can teach children and young men, who are learning how to program, how we learned and approached programming. It can improve their understanding of the legacy software we leave for them to maintain after we retire. And broadening their horizon a bit might make them better programmers, over all."
Just look at products of diversity hires and outsourcing for plenty of examples of the later case.

"I learned to program on a PET, first in BASIC, then I started writing little assembly programs to speed up the slower bits of my programs. With a machine like a PET, every bit of hardware is directly addressable. To program it in this way you need a manual that gives you the direct memory addresses of every bit of hardware on board. there is no abstraction layer whatsoever. Want to read from a serial port? you pull a value from a specific location. want to place a character on the screen? you need to know the address of that position on the screen and then push the ascii value into it. With a computer this simple, it's well within a hobbyists capability to learn the machine completely. This got progressively more difficult, and it's probably not really worth the insane effort required to learn what makes something like an Amiga or a modern PC tick like this unless you're actually a genius working in hardware development. So it's not really about what the machine can do, but what you can learn about all the functions that still make up a modern computer, at the level of the metal, in a way that would be near impossible now due to the incredible complexity of a modern PC."
Because the government is good and gives you rights. /s
"That's what I thought. However, does the tor project actually sanction any specific onion address?"

"If you run an exit node you can easily restrict what kind of traffic leaves your node and heads to the unprotected internet, but you can't do much on a relay.  W8, didn't u mean entry node rather than exit node? I thought an exit node doesn't know the onion address I'm connecting to. If they knew it, they'd b able to know the hidden service's IP, as they must know its IP to connect to it. M I correct or do I misunderstand anything?"
That I already know. It doesn't answer my question..

They only say they can't know its owner or location.  People are just butt hurt that Tor, impotently, doesn't like white supremacists and want to claim we white people have been made victim yet again.  Oh yeah, I did get the feeling this place is swarming with neo-nazis, or at least ppl pretending to b.. Too bad, I think."

"I don't think it should be normal for the government to heavily regulate the market,   Thinking that net neutrality is an otherwise isolated bit of regulation that can be eliminated without other effect is a big problem.  The government(s) (federal, state, and local) have already granted monopolies in services and service delivery.  Things like right of way access, pole access, and cable network access have already been sold to private companies.  Now those companies want to get rid of the obligations they had to undertake to get those resources.  Sure, if we could go back to the start, we should probably do it a different way.  But since we've already sold monopolies to these companies, we need to keep them held accountable."
Urban legend. A type that's been around forever. Before that it was the Japanese drillbit NASA used a pencil for a long time then the Fisher pen company designed a pen that could be used in space using Fishers own million dollars.

"Look at it this way, would you rather let ((( Comcast ))) control what you see on the internet or not? If the answer is, Fuck anyone who would censor what I see on the internet!  Then the correct answer is to always back Net Neutrality. Since ideally true NN would result in a free market of content.    Take away Net Neutrality and Youtube will be the only video provider on the block that gets through the ISPs since ((( google ))) would make sure to pay them for the 'fast' lanes.  Then start up competing services like vid.me and bitchute  wouldn't be allowed to exist."
