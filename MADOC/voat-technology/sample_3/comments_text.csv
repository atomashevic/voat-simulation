I was told it said either ""I'm unable to understand the question"" or ""Sorry I couldn't find the answer to your question"" for all except for:  ""Alexa.

That was Hollywood. NASA doesn't make movies.
"The issue of a hijacked DLL concerns scilexer.dll (needed by Notepad++) on a compromised PC, which is replaced by a modified scilexer.dll built by the CIA.  It could affect any application which uses scilexer.dll. Also, there's nothing special about this DLL, aside from the fact that Notepad++ is very popular among technically inclined Windows users."
"If I understand the proposed fix, Notepad++ will be checking the digital signature of the affected DLL at runtime going forward. The only reason they have to do this is because you don't do it for yourself. If you want to know who you're trusting when you install software, then you have to start checking signatures."
Then it is your choice to accept the CIA signed DLL.

"According to the lawsuit, Holbrook, a journeyman technician, was performing routine maintenance on one of the robots on the trailer hitch assembly line when the unit unexpectedly activated and attempted to load a part into the unit being repaired, crushing Holbrook's head. Now Holbrook's estate is suing the three companies that built the robots (Fanuc America, Nachi Robotic, and Lincoln Electric) for failing to design adequate safeguards and protections into the robots. They're also suing two other companies that installed and maintained the unit (Flex-N-Gate, Prodomax) for failing to prevent an accident they say would have been avoided had safety been a higher priority.  I think they are saying there that they didn't have the ability to do so... If that is the case that is fucked up. I'm a millwright assistant and I've never seen something you couldn't lock out."

You fail at science.  2.4ghz is non-ionizing radiation and therefor cannot harm your body unless you put out such a high wattage that you literally cause immediate physical burns (think shoving your head inside a microwave oven).
"Radiation next to your skull is not a concern but higher power levels are because they drain batteries quickly.  Bluetooth is intended to be low power, low bandwidth for portable devicea with tiny batteries."

"Actually the frequency range of Bluetooth is a superset of 2.4Ghz WiFi.  Instead of being a good neighbor and looking for an uncrowded channel in that range, Bluetooth continuously rotates through the entire range, so that whatever channel you pick for WiFi it will screw with it.  And it still manages to have horribly low bandwidth and latency higher than you can get to other continents with a wired connection."

Dana, I have been saying for years exactly what you believe, that the   reactors are so radioactive that no machine, no people and no robots   could survive there. My knowledge is based upon research I did in order   to understand why my brother died of leukemia as a child. My father was a   witness to an atomic mortar shell test in 1953 while in the armed   service. Having learned the deadly effects of radiation, especially   constant low level fallout from reading Ernest Sternglasses and Sherman   and Manganos' work, it is easy to see just why so many people have their   head up their ass regarding the actual murderous nature of atomic   products. Each and every single atomic particle circumnavigating our planet is   like a bullet. Each of these quadrillions of bullets eventually finds a   target, some inanimate objects and some living tissues of plants,   animals and humans. Each of these bullets kills everything around it for   thousands of years. Each of these bullets is re-liberated when its'   host dies, and then travels around until it lands again.  The cognitive dissonance, or mass insanity of atomic products is one of   the many stupid paradigms humans are fatally attached to. The failure of   allegedly anti-nuclear activists, such as Ms.Milky, Radchick, Caldicott   and others to correctly address the actual nature of the risk at hand,   and to minimize those risks by publishing and re-posting disinformation   that will help murder life is dispicable. The reason people are not up   in arms about this is exactly because the allegedly anti nuclear crowd   is pussyfooting around the topic, because they are co-opted by the very   same forces they are taking to task, either for money, prestige or some   other very human character trait. Were the general public to actually understand the science, no atomic   products would exist. The controlled dissent of a bunch of allegedly   anti-nuclear people is collaboration to murder, genocide and their words   should be taken to task, just like the insane words of more major media   sources. Only then can we possibly sway more public opinion to the   immediate and pressing task of stopping all nuclear products, and   investing our war machine into a peace machine that fixes the problems   we, and it have caused. There is no way Gunderson or anyone can even get close to Fukushima. Gunderson, especially is an accomplice to murder, because he makes a living on nuclear products.﻿"

"Intriguing thought. I've been going back and forth on this. On the one hand, you've got reports that Assange has been dead since October and Wikileaks is now under full CIA control. Of course that also requires one to buy the whole CGI Assange theory in his AMA in December/January. Although this is plausible, I personally find unlikely. No reason for my belief other than just a hunch. On the other hand, you've got to realize that this lends a substantial amount of credibility in all sorts of civil litigation cases where the so-called ""state secrets"" protection may have otherwise been claimed. Prosecutors and defense attorneys now have a huge set of tools they can use to defend innocent clients as well as prosecute the government for Constitutional violations."

"Yeah, but you can find a way to make this stuff relevant to them. Show them what the FBI and IRS did to the TEA party. Show them how the CIA started the Vietnam war and got tens of thousands of Americans killed. Vietnam wasn't that long ago and could be repeated with another country in our lifetime, causing tens of thousands more Americans to die because of a belligerent intelligence agency and greedy military industrial complex."
"That's a very significant finding. It turns the Trump/Russia conspiracy theory on its head, as well as the Russian election hacking scandal. It proves that it is entirely possible that it was the CIA that did these things."
This release is significant. Wikileaks just isn't spoon feeding Americans about why we should care - that would be considered spin and narrative-pushing. It's up to us to take the information and decide how it affects us and share our thoughts about the consequences of this overreach of power with everyone we know and care about to spread the word even further and demand action from Congress by calling them and showing up to town hall meetings to ask about it and demand action.
The CIA has already been caught doing this. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/feinstein-cia-searched-intelligence-committee-computers/2014/03/11/982cbc2c-a923-11e3-8599-ce7295b6851c_story.html

We know you're out there reluctant Satanists, just do the right thing and come forward You can still redeem yourselves."
"That's probably correct - it seems that most people have become fed up and fatigued from news in general and if the news isn't spoon-fed into them, they tend to blink and miss it. At the weekend I brought up the Vault 7 leaks with several people expecting to have an interesting conversation and ended up having to explain it to like 3 different people since none of them even bothered to do any research at all. It is genuinely disappointing how ill-informed the average person is."
"Too easy to say. I'd drop off the ""old men"" part.  I'd agree if you said:  The Constitution was supposed to mean something before everything got skewed by people and groups pushing their own agenda."
"For instance: I found it surprising that the CIA didn't even try to break Signal, since they just interjected themselves between your software keyboard and the Signal app, and grabbed the data they needed before it was even encrypted.   That's best practice since long ago for most. Listening in on communication by tapping the lines and solving decryption is a much bigger hurdle than deploying some malware and straight up getting everything in plaintext. Basically everyone outside of big agencies has been relying on this as wiretapping was outside their abilities and anti-virus is much worse than public perception."
John Oliver talked about it last night for a couple minutes saying it was no big deal.
"because it's not just the CIA taking advantage of exploits the CIA have uncovered.  You would care if key logger undetected by virus protection thanks to a CIA leak got your credit card details.  People cannot say the CIA are protecting citizens when they uncover faults but leave them open to suit their own needs. Then there's the whole ""who watches the watchers"" thing.  NSA people actively spy on their loved ones, who else do they spy on and for what reasons?  Being as it's all ""secret"", there is zero public accountability on this"

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy_of_Australia  As of 2016, Federal energy policies continue to support the coal mining and natural gas industries through subsidies for fossil fuel use and production as the exports by those industries contribute significantly to the earnings of foreign exchange and government revenues. Australia is one of the most coal-dependent countries in the world.[2] Coal and natural gas, along with oil-based products, are currently the primary sources of Australian energy usage and the coal industry produces approximately 38% of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions. In 2015 Federal policy reverted to a pro-coal economy with cuts to alternate and renewable energy government offices, targets and subsidies [3]  see also  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_Australia#Renewable_energy_programmes"

IIRC he was also talking about ""balance"" in terms of who has the rights to what.

So wouldn't you say they had significant control? And there are plenty of such chokepoints in the whole structure that allow wide influence."

"It takes a large capital investment to make and program robots, it was cheaper to just go to China where they have the factories, the people, and the resources to just build stuff."
"Well, by definition the closer everything moves to zero cost of production the closer humanity moves to a post scarcity society. Say with molecular 3D printing and massively cheap/powerful solar energy an individual only needs $1 per year to buy goods/services. Regardless of how hard or easy it would be to earn that dollar there would still be massive overproduction of products/services in relation to individual demand.  For example African nations used to employ many tailors to manufacture clothing but as basic clothing production cost has dropped 100 fold over the past century people have so much clothes they have trouble donating all of it and thousands of tons of free clothes are dumped on African shores each year rendering those tailor jobs as unnecessary novelties."
"At this point there are not ""general purpose"" industrial robots. An automation solution has to go through a firm, and be built pretty much from scratch. The costs of the physical machines and maintenance is cheaper than employees, but getting to that point is still expensive and requires an investment. If you have a production line that can be parallelized then your 2nd, 3rd, ... copies of the line are much cheaper, and that is why amazon is a lot more automated than bob's bait and tackle shop; once a system is in place they can price out competition and cheaply expand. This is also why fast food is going that way as well, but not independent restaurants."
"In some cases that's called Maintenance. But I see where you were going with that. I look flrward to the day that all our needs and wants can be provided for, and the only ""work"" we do is creative outlets and prestige. But we have to do something lest we become like the Eloi from the Time Traveller."
"Either most people don't care about privacy or we, the tech community, do a poor job of connecting things like encryption to what people do genuinely care about.  Huh... I had never really thought about it that way. I think it's definitely a mixture of both - there are people who post nude pics to public sites and there are people who won't communicate without encryption - moat of the public seems to side closer to the former than the latter. Additionally I think the tech industry (though I admit there are heavy outside influences) have done poorly to champion online privacy. What I do wonder is how much influence intelligence agencies have on tech companies and the extent of how popular certain encryption is. Could someone in CIA incentivize you to keep security down? We already know they pursue zero day exploits"
"Well other than all of the malicious reasons, it's good for companies to record things like product usage when appropriate to help the company study their current product and how it is used.  If you and I bought the same vibrator somehow you might use it 8 times in a day whereas I use it 8 times an hour. It's useful to know what an average usage of your product is like. This helps the team who created the vibrator plan for future products, as well as provide an honest feedback on their current product. Imagine asking a group of women to disclose their average vibrator use - you can imagine how intrusive this survey would be and the amount of answers that are untruthful or exaggerated.  That being said, I think it's creepy that someone can look at your vibrator from the internet and tell if it's being used. It should be readily disclosed to the consumer, possibly anonymized somehow"

"yep essentially. Theres two ways this can happen, first is programmer made a boo boo and the second is that the hardware in use was just not calibrated, tested, or compensated for. Theres a couple other edge case scenarios that are probably relevant to the test scenario shown, voltage drops being the most obvious one but its a bit of a long shot they didn't take that into consideration."
"The correct way to do this is to integrate the voltage x the current, but that isn't as easy as taking the peak. When you get to things like LEDs you might have a driver that only takes a very small amount of the waveform, and so that could be read much higher than it should be.  Funny that the people that tries to save the most actually gets toasted."
The meter designers know this. They chose to ignore certain kinds of loads either to save money on the meter design or to do what it does now: over read current draw. I don't like either scenario.
"They move to China to avoid the regulatory cost of cleaning up the toxic trash they spew out when allowed to be ""free market"" capitalists. Labor is just an easier excuse that doesn't get as much backlash as making a river/lake catch on fire."

That's actually really bad. Because switching power supplies are becoming more and more common. The effect of resistive loads will only diminish

"In general with technology if you're okay with 'X"" agency covertly collecting information on you, whether that be Microsoft or the NSA. Then you should also be okay with Y and Z getting access to that information which may be foreign countries, criminal actors, or anybody in between. In technology simultaneous discovery is a constantly recurring theme. And this also ignores spies, hacks, and other 'less natural' means of sending information from X to Y and Z. And this also ignores the human aspect. In the NSA leaks we've seen the NSA agents sharing 'privately' sent nudes, spying on their significant others, and more. Those sort of things are flagrant abuses of information that's not being responsibly used. And that's to be expected because ""intelligence agency"" isn't some sort of opaque entity made of ubermen. It's just a group of normal, flawed people - like the rest of us - that you're entrusting an enormous amount of power and trying to sacrifice your privacy to."

"Keep in mind there are no compilers and as such no games currently available which provide optimizations for these games. So all game benchmarks are basically useless until games are updated to allow for such optimizations. There is, of course, a pragmatic side to desiring such benchmarks, because of course you want to know how it will run today. That certainly has merit. But it says absolutely nothing as a relative benchmark for future performance potential. As such, can also be very misleading. In otherwords, the benchmarks will only tell you relatively how well it will perform today. It says absolutely nothing about how well it will perform tomorrow.

There are plenty of airports with underground electric trams.
Why can you understand Europa lander?Its the one mission with the highest % chance of finding more complex life in the solar system than bacteria.
Also the chaos of determining where people exactly land or take off.  One overloaded cargo jet might inadvertently run into the next guys tail - but that is just another scenario what you were talking about.  It's a safety disaster.
"Lets talk about instrument procedures. Yes, theoretically you can land/take-off from any given point in the circle. But when it's foggy... then what? Are they going to have 36 different RNAV approach procedures for every 10° of the circle? RNAV typically have 8 different fixes each. Imagine the controller's screen... it'll look like a circular loom. What about ILS... how is the ILS going to work? Are they going to have 36 different ILS systems set up with 36 different assigned frequencies? They take a lot of effort and money for constant testing and certification too. 2 ILS systems per runway now becomes 36...not very cost efficient. If there are several airports in close proximity, they'll run out of radio frequency (either that or there'll be bleed between the frequencies if the weather is less than perfect). How do you add an extra runway when it gets really busy? An outer ring? How do you do plan approaches that don't interfere with the inner ring? It seems like too much dreaming, and not real questions being answered."

"It would work if the runway were banked progressively steeper toward the outside. With the right banking there is zero lateral force on the landing gear. There are three actual physics-based problems. First, the takeoff lift becomes the sum of the gravitational weight and the centrifugal weight. This is a show-stopper. The extra structural strength needed would make the plane heavier, which is catastrophic for fuel efficiency. Efficiency is the king that rules the land of civil aviation. Second, mishaps would be very difficult owing to the banking. The plane has to choose the radius that matches its speed, otherwise the lateral forces will be unacceptable. Imagine what would happen if a plane braked too far up the slope and then caught on fire. It would be tricky to safely evacuate the passengers. The fire fighting equipment would have to fight an uphill battle on a slope banked for 500 knots. Burning fuel would run downhill, escaping from underneath firefighting foam, necessitating a system of drains everywhere in the runway with frequent maintenance. Third, the rim of the runway bowl is likely to create unpredictable vortices under high wind conditions. The rudder would have to be controlled by an advanced AI. On the other hand, these people have clearly identified the inherent transportation efficiency of circular routes. Perhaps we could use conventional linear runways, and use a circular route to shuttle planes between the runways and the terminal. Underground tunnels with a tow train for the planes would work but be extravagantly expensive. How about a series of small terminals around the outside of the runways, and a subway train to carry passengers between them in an endless loop?  Like the DFW airport but without planes dodging each other on the runways."

"I had cable and a voip phone for a year and had no idea. They were bundled in with my internet ""deal"". When the deal was over, I reviewed my first bill and dropped everything but the internet. Having a streaming service and a cell phone means cable and a home phone are pretty useless things imo."
Technically you can serve more content for cheaper but that's why they need to become the cheap option.  Charge people $1 a month per channel.  That seems to be about as low as you have to go to be comparable in value. Of course you need a fixed cost for setting it up and laying lines.  That's why a tv-only service isn't really comparable with netflix and those other options.  You still need a line laid to get those.  What should be compared is the difference between internet cable and a tv added.  Still not worth it.  They are giving consumers too much and crap they don't even want.  Once we had only a few channels then it exploded.  Streaming may make it right for there to be fewer channels again.

It’s even harder when you’ve been isolated from standards and openness, psychologically beaten down, financially controlled, and digitally threatened. If you’re trying to decide whether to stay or leave, you may be feeling confused, uncertain, frightened, and torn. One moment, you may desperately want to get away, and the next, you may want to hang on to the platform.

"I wish people gave more thought to nuclear energy. It really is the only viable choice to satisfy not only todays demands but tomorrows as well.  Meltdowns are still an enormous problem but as long as you build it with a just in case mindset you can handle most if not any serious events with the exception of a perfect storm of unlikely scenarios. Chernobyl had design deficiencies preventing an adequate containment, Fukushima had sea wall protection but because the entire land mass shifted down several meters it was inadequate to prevent a massive wave crippling the facilities backup cooling system.     Environmental impact of constructing it? Depends on the scale of the site but generally speaking most nuclear power plants are built to last generations not a handful of decades so its a big project with a big carbon footprint which it eventually offsets during its operational life.    Depleted core material? There was a plan to store them in a mountainside vault in sealed containers preventing most if not all all radioactive contamination for millennia but right now, as of today most spent core material is kept on site in steel or concrete casks because of public fear of moving it from where its not completely safe to where it would be most likely safe for the foreseeable future. Hell even some newer generations of reactor designs can use older refurbished spent fuel as fuel. But what about hydro or wind? First hydroelectric dam construction is just as environmentally impacting as a nuclear plant, first in the sheer carbon footprint secondly in the massive impact it has on the area, that and you can't just do it everywhere there are only so many sites where not only can you put in a dam, build up a reliable reservoir, AND generate enough electricity close enough to where it will be most useful, if a dam fails it has this habit of you know causing a massive flood oh and because dams can only contain X amount of water safely if there is flooding the dam operators open up the dam to relieve some of the pressure which will cause flooding in extreme weather.  Wind is great when your conditions are ideal it also scales really well but you basically have airplane wing sized turbine blades spinning on a shaft that sits on a tower dozens of meters in the air, you've got at least a couple dozen of them in any given wind farm so maintenance is a very big, very laborious, very weather sensitive headache. Just like hydro theres only so many sites where its very effective, if the wind is too high you shut down, if its too low you shut down and do preventative maintenance, if its just right you try to only run as many turbines as needed and try doing preventative maintenance. Its also noisy as fuck, I will say this for it if you get the chance and own the kind of property where you can have one or more to offset your homes energy usage it is a legitimate way to save a small fortune if you can keep it the noise to a minimum and have some way to maintain it."

"Well radio waves ARE light. Also, it's light that interacts with your flesh a lot less than infrared does. Wouldn't that likely be safer?"
"It is unfortunate that the US government decided that pressurized water reactors using uranium were the way nuclear power should be done as opposed to liquid fluoride thorium reactors. That decision was likely made because spent fuel from a reactor running on lightly enriched uranium can be reprocessed to make plutonium-239 for nuclear weapons. Compared to pressurized water reactors liquid fluoride thorium reactors are safer in the event of loss of cooling/power , produce less high level radioactive waste, and uses up thorium which is a waste product of the rare earth mining industry without needing the isotopic enrichment of uranium. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory built the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment back in the 60's to prove out some of the concepts but the second phase where they would use thorium got canceled. There is a good period documentary about the MSRE here (20 minutes)."
"The lack of penetration could actually be a benefit, especially for people who live in apartments or high-density neighborhoods. No better security than complete lack of reception outside of intended rooms."

"I started programming on a CBM PET 3008 back in 1979. The BASIC was pretty crap compared with even Sinclair BASIC but it could still do some cool stuff. The problem was that BASIC 4.0 on the C64 didn't have any controls for graphics or sound and it all had to be done with PEEK and POKE which was incredibly primitive. Simon's BASIC improved the situation a lot giving the user commands for drawing objects, sprites etc and driving the SID chip more easily. Such a pity that so few people who got the C64 ever went on to program them. Personally, I got a BBC Micro which had a really excellent BASIC interpreter, including an inline assembler for machine code and all the necessary commands to drive the graphics and sound. I learnt a lot on that and it has lead me to a very good career as a programmer. The C64 really ended up being a games machine and little else sadly."

"Networking and network programming are two very different things. I'm sure this is a fantastic resource for people looking to write netcode, but that's not the same as networking. Hell, the word ""Cable"" does not appear even once in the entire thing. If you are looking  for details on how to set up a network for a large building, that resource is practically useless. You need to know, or at least know where to find, things like safe transmission distances of various cable standards, the pinout of an RJ45 jack (assuming you will EVER punch down or crimp your own cable. I'm seeing more and more places just use miles and miles of precut patch cord). DHCP is only mentioned in passing, but if you are, say, trying to get a series of wireless access points to all work together under one routing server, that's kind of a really, REALLY important service to know. But that guide is not targeted to the people setting up the servers, its targeted to the people writing the code that runs them. OP asked about guides on networking. You gave him a guide on the related, but very different subject of network programming."

Capitalism in action.

"Self driving robotic trucks will make a big impact, even if just driving from Distro center to Distro center."
OTOH I expect technology to progress faster than many expect.
As much as I would love to see a general rollout of self driving vehicles - talk to some people in the industry.  It will be a long while before the algorithms are solid enough to be a full replacement for the human driver.  At best it could be a really good cruise control now and for at least the next few years.    In test tracks and in advertising campaigns you might have short runs of AI trucking - but the general rollout would have to be absolutely rock solid.  It simply is not there.  There are still far too many points of failure and far too many places where the AI does not come up with the correct solution for it to be something to trust to drive a 50 thousand pound load.    The test cases that are publicized now are in best case environments without a lot of extraneous details that fall outside the training sets.  They are also reliant on a lot of very finicky tech that fails frequently in ways that cannot be predicted.  Its sort of like were VR was about 30 years ago.  The idea was there - and a lot of the tech was there - and you could build an expensive test rig for it - but it was not public ready.    It may not be 50 years - but I think it would be optimistic to think there would be general purpose trucking done by AI in 20 years. Some problems are really hard.  This problem is really really hard.

The thing you are trying to say is the invisible hand of the free market which will not ever exist since the fuckers in this are not rational and never will be."
Trump is for this dude (he favors businesses). Same for spying on you.
Thank late stage capitalism for these laws.
"IMO the only thing that should ever be written in JS is code for webpages, because there's no alternative. JS is one of messiest languages ever."
"There's a subtlety involved here though. The Gorean philosophy is fundamentally toxic, and the people who take it too seriously tend to be shunned by the wider BDSM community as well. It's one thing to play fantasies based on it, another to truly believe and act like women are inferior beasts that need to be tamed, especially in a professional context."
"This is a very important detail. Gorean philosophy vs general BDSM. I'd like to further put a subtlety on your post: there is nothing wrong about enjoying Gorean-style BDSM play. Emphasis on play. But there are sadly many people who take it way too seriously, and I cannot see how these people could, as you say, claim to support gender equality in any way."
Gaaaay. Then you die dreaming about all the shit you wish you would've done while you still had the time.
I believe Kodak tried to make printers with reasonably-priced ink. Nobody bought it because the printer itself was expensive(razor-and-blades is a powerful business model).
"While I agree with you in a way..  However, when a highly-visible community member's private views become public, controversial, and disruptive for the project, I must consider the impact that his words and actions have on others and the project itself. In this case, Larry has entwined his private and professional online identities in such a way that it blurs the lines with the Drupal project.  How you get your dick hard is your private business. Sharing it publicly is your choice - but is not without consequence. Nor should it be. When you are a prominent member of an organization, your actions represent that organization and you are expected to act in accordance with that responsibility. I wouldn't expect to keep my job if I publicly said I masturbate to hentai... So we have two options:  You censor yourself out of common respect to others (have a private online persona to discuss your private life), OR We force everyone else to censor their response your kinks.  Which is more oppressive? And further, the guy is treating it like he's some martyr in the crusade for tolerance.  While western culture has grown dramatically more tolerant of diverse practices and lifestyles in the past few decades, there is still much work to be done. In particular, there is still an enormous stigma around those who practice alternative sexuality lifestyles, such as the BDSM community, Leather community, and so on.  I don't have to be tolerant of what gets your dick hard. That's your private business. Keep it fucking private and it's not an issue. It's not my responsibility to be morally OK with your kinks... It's your responsibility to keep your kinks to yourself. I don't see the fucking controversy here."
"aftermarket firms could cease to exist  It's already happening. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartridge_World I used to keep mum about my employer when discussing this industry online.  Not anymore.  This shit is fucked.

HP makes such low quality cartridges we can hardly reuse them, plus they're priced at such a low sticker price but high cost per mL that people won't fight traffic and pass other retailers just to save a few bucks. https://www.printzone.com.au/blog/cartridge-world-where-to/ Even the office supply stores that used to refill in-house have pulled out and just sell finished product manufactured by Clover Technologies."

"The real scary part is that these are not the ""throw away the laws, do whatever is right"" guys here.  These are the lawmen doing this.  This is a very targeted type of finding, one that is meant to be safe.  In this case, they are using the fact that they ""know"" that the data exists.  This finding is crafted to chip away just a small part of the fifth amendment, not remove it totally, and the scary part is that these judges think that is a reasonable thing to do.  That's the bad part- the fact that this sort of attack is universally recognized as safe and wise in judicial circles.    I would assume that a competent lawyer would be able to argue that if the government KNOWS he has contraband, they should be able to convict him on that.  Since they obviously can't, then they don't know that fact, therefore he's being forced to testify against himself.  I think the 3-0 ruling is in part because the guy is obviously guilty, but that's not really the point here- once the fifth amendment stops existing for criminals, it stops existing period.    Note that this isn't the only, or the definitive, law in this case.  The EFF has been following these types of cases for years.  The ones that they go forward on are almost always dudes with child porn, who are despised so utterly, and whose cases are disturbing and impolite enough, that not only are they successful at chipping away at the constitution, they are doing so in a way that not many people want to talk about because it isn't a fun conversation at dinner."
"Don't waste your time encrypting.  Just cat out random data to fill the drive!  Any random data that is evenly divisible by 512 bytes is apparently evidence of literally everything!  After all, you can't distinguish encrypted data from random data with any mathematical test, so why waste your time! Ok it's not really that bad yet, but it is getting there.  We'll have to wait for more rulings on this- I doubt very much any law makers will touch this kind of sticky crap."

"If you read the whole thing, it actually tells you that VPN's can be bad and it's almost impossible to know which one to trust.  Too many people use bullshit antivirus, bullshit vpn, all kinds of stuff because they assume that it does what it says it does.  There's a lot of money to be made in lying cheating and stealing - it's the modern business model that Microsoft uses, as well as many other shady organizations."
"Well, the point of a VPN is that you are choosing someone who is there to help protect you digitally. The point is that it's not someone who's going to sell your data even if they had the explicit blessing of the Senate (which is disgusting). Their service is VPN... Not the same as ISP..."
Yup something else to buy. like when the asshole phone companies charged you TO NOT print your phone number.

"While i understand what you are saying, I think that this is the way medicine is going. What i would like to see in situations like this is access to the DB without any personal information. I think that such a database/account would be fine. Imagine this: we have so many people going through chemo for different types of cancers, what if we plugged all the parameters, for all the patients ever treated with chemo, into some ML code and we could tailor someone's chemo that way. It would immediately be better than the best doctor that ever lived, and it would allow probing on other axes. It would also, most likely, find that some of the cheaper solutions are actually better than some of the very expensive ones."
"That reminds me of an interesting study they had on doctors and statistical understanding.  Ten out of every 1,000 women have breast cancer. Of these 10 women with breast cancer, 9 test positive. Of the 990 women without cancer, about 89 nevertheless test positive. A woman tests positive and wants to know whether she has breast cancer for sure, or at least what the chances are. What is the best answer?   The vast majority of doctors miss that question even in that very pedantic form. In reality it should also be able to be derived from these three points:  The probability that a woman has breast cancer is 1% (""prevalence"") If a woman has breast cancer, the probability that she tests positive is 90% (""sensitivity"") If a woman does not have breast cancer, the probability that she nevertheless tests positive is 9% (""false alarm rate"")  When phrased that way more than half said it was 90% likely that a person who tests positive has breast cancer has it, and only 21% gave the correct answer.    That article also goes into misleading marketing for commercialized medicine, and ""early detection."" On the topic of breast cancer, 4 out of 1000 screened women will die from breast cancer. 5 out of 1000 unscreened women will die from breast cancer. This is a difference of less than 1 in 1000 but is marked as a ""20% reduction in mortality"" leading people to believe that if you take 1000 people, 200 lives will have been saved by early cancer screening. Yay for mixing profit and healthcare. What could go wrong?"

"As programmer (and therefore someone who understands logic)  Then it's logical for you to understand that you will not be paid for your 'diagnosis', because that's what they bought the machine for. You aren't providing answers, the machine is. You will be paid on an as-needed base to re calibrate the machine when false positives reach a predetermined amount. You'll be the person who gets called twice a year - like a copier tech. You will just be a glorified copier technician.   Isn't a 10x failure rate worth a 100x cost reduction?  Sure - until your mom comes to you and says the machine didn't read it right, she thought everything was fine, computer did not suggest a follow up, and now she has galluping cancer. That kind sucks, and there won't be a human to talk to about it - it's all a machine and that dumbass tech was out last week and promised everything was fine.   My diagnosis: not cancer.  But it's not your diagnosis. You will be given parameters to put into the programing, a little check, and then sent on your way. I see some engineering and programmers getting really excited about this, and truthfully, I am too - but be serious. You're a code jockey and not that important. As a matter of fact, there are hundreds like you willing to take less pay and travel farther."

"Copyright law was intended to benefit us, the public.  Contract law requires consideration for both parties.  If not, then the contract is null & void.  The consideration for the public's end of copyright law was that we would get more works in the public domain.  The consideration for copyright holders was that our government would grant a temporary monopoly over their work.  The temporary part has been reneged on, and the public domain has not grown as promised.  Therefore, copyright law, if it were a contract, would be null & void. Regardless of the technicalities, we know that it is not fair.  Their temporary, government enforced, monopoly (copyright) is not a right.  It is a privilege that ""we the people"" granted them for more works in the public domain based on the promise that it would be a bargain for us.  Instead, not only has the rate of works entering the public domain decreased, copyright law is abused to hold technological progress back in order to protect the profits of the very entities that have reneged on the promise of copyright law."

Rather than bitching about it or what others post, I chose to post interesting content whenever and wherever I came across it. I would prefer to say I saw it on VOAT first.

Never before have they been able to collect information on 99% of your life, and they're screaching and blaming that 1% they can't get access to as the reason they continuously drop the ball.

There are probably hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of people in the UK who do suspicious stuff, who are involved in extremism in some form or another even if it's only twitter posting.

"I think they are making fun of  ""bigly"""
"Some background on it. from kia  Up until that December 2, 2016 rule was introduced, ISPs had as few regulations against their collecting of data as companies like Facebook and Google (that is, basically zero regulations). The rule was to enforce an opt-out system, among other things, to keep user's data private from ISPs, while not doing anything against Facebook/Google. Most importantly, this rule was never actually put into action. Literally nothing changes if Trump signs this bill. The rule was flawed to begin with, as it had a ""one rule for me, another for thee"" tone to it, where ISPs would be barred from selling their customer's data when every other company (again, Facebook and Google are the biggest offenders) routinely do it. Now, I'm not saying that I like the fact that my data is collected and sold, nor do I think it should be allowed. But not only is the passage of this bill through the House and Senate not actually changing anything, even if Trump signs it, it's a severely flawed rule anyway that punishes the ""bad"" ISPs while leaving the ""good"" companies completely alone.  from h8chan  it's to repeal Fed. Reg. 87274. I haven't read the whole text for the regulation because it's really fucking long but some anons on /pol/ are saying it gives censorship powers to the FCC. But that's besides the point, the regulation was introduced just a few months ago and never implemented, so at worst nothing is going to change, but everybody is losing their shit as if ISPs will suddenly be allowed to fuck you over in some way they weren't allowed before."

just a lot of hypochondriacs like with higher frame rates in cinemas.  I see what you did there Some limits we just can't overcome. Just its as impossible to  toughening the organism up to withstand EM. Unless we genetically engineer people to appreciate the new technologies they will not have a market. Breeding special people to watch movies seems like a really desperate length to go to..

Airgap is not gg if you want to defend against surveillance. You can gather data by the electromagnetic output electronics produce when they are working. The catchterm for this is tempest. One of the more famous examples was a guy running along wallstreet back when the big monitors were modern and showing people how he could reproduce the screen of the people in the building. This is also why movies showcase sometimes the hacker sitting in a faraday cage. It's not that easy though - if it's too thin it does jackshit. Supposedly the real secure ones got massive walls to be really secure and naturally any energy comes internally as the electric wiring could be read if it goes outside.
"Surveillance would fall under offensive. Not only broad measures but also attacks on individuals - you might remember released papers 25+ years after the dead of famous people along the lines of ""we though he was dangerous so we surveiled him"" - that needs people and that costs. Also industry spionage is most likely included here - just as the US is victim to chinese industry spionage. Attacking back is actually easier and more effective than trying to be watertight yourself so it makes sense to put most money there."

Trying to fuck up reddit with bots is like pissing in an ocean of piss. It's already being fucked by all kinds of bots.
"The key to a fun and disruptive bot on reddit is to play by the rules and use the api tools available. https://snew.github.io uses official reddit apis, follows all of the guidelines and I handed off control of the api keys to trusted people's reddit accounts before I cut off all association with reddit. They haven't banned it and I commend them for that at least. Before that politicbot and modsarekillingreddit/moderationlog before that played by the rules, and forced the admins to make new rules against it: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModsAreKillingReddit/comments/qtbsh/announcement_modsarekillingreddit_will_no_longer/ I shut down those myself because I wanted to stop contributing to reddit after it abandoned the principles of free speech.  PoliticBot and /r/POLITIC was gaining traction and would likely still gain traction if I or someone else ran it or something similar today and reddit allowed it."

"Absolutely, I could not agree more. For a heavy user, it is not a suitable replacement. But for a light user, who just needs a smart phone for work, and basic web browsing, word processing .etc, the people who don't want computers to take over their lives, I see this as a simple one size fits all solution.  Unfortunately for samsung, that generation isn't the ones buying new flagship phones. I could potentially see this being used by the traveling executive, though, much lighter than a laptop, and it can run powerpoint, kinda the use case of the intel compute stick; use it for work when traveling, have an actual PC for heavier work that you no longer have to take with you."

"No, it's not. It's risk mitigation by pooling a little money from many people to cover expensive damages/liabilities that are rare but could happen to anyone in the pool. Think of insurance against your house burning down. And that is very useful. The problem is that nowadays the term insurance is often used for financial products, which have nothing to do with insurance, i.e. risk mitigation. Like whole life insurance or health insurance. They are more like financing plans or just plain subsidies. Often because of government requirements, which have nothing to do with actual risk. Think birth control vs. cancer in health ""insurance"". Birth control is no risk which needs to be mitigated, it's just a subsidy. Cancer, on the other hand, is a rare but catastrophic risk you better get covered."

"If you go in knowing how it works it isn't fraud and any agent is happy to explain the process to it, the companies them selves don't even try to hide it and the fact that they like every other business try to turn a profit isn't hidden either. You may not like how it works but fraud it is not."
"Those reasons for Tesla some make sense, I'm in MI so historically we had a lot of cars made here and if they could have sold directly out the factory door they could have priced in a way that people in other states would have no way of matching due to low storage costs no dealer and even no shipping costs. Any location with an auto factory near by would have been able to destroy the ability for anyone else to sell near there. Ford didn't want Dodge to have and advantage in some markets and Dodge didn't want Ford to have an advantage in others so they wound up with a process to cut both off and make it fair through a dealer."

"For all that it is touted, DuckDuckGo has some questionable things itself.  Unfortunately I don't recall precisely what it is off-hand (though the CEO was apparently involved in some reselling of personal information at one point), but I wouldn't consider it to be a one-stop-shop for ensuring Internet freedom by any means, including defense of privacy.  It might be resistant to Google's censorship, but AFAIK some of its data comes from Google, so that part's probably tainted from the source, at least."

I would assume that it would figure out percentage of similarity between pictures by looking at every pixel, comparing it to the original, and return a percentage of how many pixels are the same or close enough. It also wouldn't surprise me in this case if it would weight any flesh colored pixels as more important to avoid people just changing the background of the image."
Sadly so true ...
"a lot of companies make this mistake.   The mistake companies repeatedly make is replacing innovators with MBAs. Once there is a suffcient mass of MBA's, or the creators in the company are forced out,  you should probably look into shorting the company.

"I suspect that Canonical is seeing a relatively high number of new installs. Probably not anything that would hurt Microsoft but anecdotally, I've seen a lot of people who dislike Windows 10 enough to either stay with 7 (or even 8) indefinitely and a handful of people who have moved over to Linux (mostly Ubuntu). All of my family (save for my brother who refuses to give up 7) are on some variant of Ubuntu and I use vanilla Ubuntu. I can't say this news makes me happy. I really like Unity 7 (not sure what to think about 8 yet) and hope 18.04 ships with Unity-like Gnome setup. Otherwise I'll probably have to move to Kubuntu as Gnome wastes an awful lot of screen space."

"Never. Linux has many distributions for many different purposes.  Most novices would be far less comfortable with Red Hat than with Ubuntu or Mint.  Similarly, a highly technical person who liked traditional Unix would find Slackware much more acceptable than SuSE, which is set up to have a somewhat prettier experience.  This does not count the numerous specialized distributions such as all the anti-virus live CDs you can boot off of to help your computer in an emergency, since most of those run some version of Linux on top of a bare-bones distribution. There may be too many distributions around, but there will never be a single, unified thrust.  It's better that way, considering how versatile it is.  While some of the BSD's may be more unified, you also have to do much of the customization on your own, at the very least.  It's certainly more customizable than the mess of Windows versions and Windows Server versions. I think this situation would be helped a lot if there was more unified binary capability and a significantly better install system.  As-is everything that isn't specifically distributed by the distro maker can be an ordeal to install for a novice, and it just shouldn't be like that, nor should it be that a software producer puts out two or three packages for a few very specific distros and versions (e.g. offering for download, say, a .deb for Ubuntu 16.04 and .rpm SuSE 5.0, and tough shit if you're on Debian, Mint, Red Hat, or Ubuntu versions other than 16.04).

"I was really surprised about that too. I used to be in a warehouse where robots controlled 29 000 pallets and the robots were basically just fork lifts on a rail. Rails were really long, 11 pallets on top of each other. Pallets are of course big but there was a smaller automated storage too where you ordered a plastic box full of items from a numbered shelf and the plastic box came to the collection spot in less than ten seconds or so. Moving the shelfs like in the video looks slow to me and if the robots get messed up, what a job to get the shelfs in order again!"
"My cousin runs his Kofi set up through a raspberry pi, running debian on it. He also set up emulators on it for NES, SNES, Dreamcast, and N64. We live in the best of times."
"Many TV's have microphones, and it's been fairly common for the last few years at least. If someone hacks your TV, they can get a record of what you watch and when, and more worryingly, they can then tap the microphone in your TV and listen to everything you say in your living room, or bedroom, or wherever you have the TV.     And before anyone tries to paint this picture, there's nobody sitting with headphones on listening to hacked streams live. It all gets recorded, saved, and automatically transcribed into searchable text. Or malicious hackers could just break your TV entirely."
Orange pi is not associated with raspberry pi. They are a chinesium product.
So someone doesn't copy it and release their own version of the same software without putting the work in while stealing market share.
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from being in a video game
Hadn't heard about that. Thanks for letting me know. Next time I need to upgrade I will be getting Orange Pi instead.
